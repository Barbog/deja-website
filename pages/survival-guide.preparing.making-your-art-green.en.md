<span class="center" style="color:lime;"> <u>**Making Your Art Green**</u></span>

Thank you for contributing art to DeJā.  Art is at the center of our community.  This section can give you some valuable insights and shifts in perspective that will help you make your art more environmentally friendly.

Again, we recommend the 6 R’s:
- **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Respect.  </span>**
- **<span style="color:lime;">Rethink.</span>**
- **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Reduce.</span>**
- **<span style="color:lime;">Reuse. </span>**
- **<span style ="color:darkgreen;">Recycle.</span>**
- **<span style="color:lime;">Restore.</span>**


<span style="color:greenyellow;">**Materials**</span>

It is during your planning phase that it is most important to think about the end-game — where will your materials end up?

<span style="color:dodgerblue;">**Think**</span> about your material choices chronologically, and ask yourself:

- Where did they come from?
- How can I use them the most efficiently?
- Where will they end up when I’m done? Landfill?
- Repurposed?
- Burned?
- What’s the most environmentally friendly choice I can make?

<span style="color:lime;"> Purchase or acquire</span> materials from socially and environmentally conscious sources.

Explore the options for obtaining repurposed materials in your area.

Wherever possible, consider the <span style ="color:lime;">6R</span><span style ="color:darkgreen;">'s</span> first before buying new.

Although it can be more challenging to use repurposed materials, it is more  interesting and compelling to see how you can transmorph the lifecycle of an object.
