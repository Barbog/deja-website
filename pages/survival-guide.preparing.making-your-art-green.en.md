<span class="center" style="color:lime;"> <u>**Making Your Art Green**</u></span>

Thank you for contributing art to DeJā.  Art is at the center of our community.  This section can give you some valuable insights and shifts in perspective that will help you make your art more environmentally friendly.

Again, we recommend the 6 R’s:
- **<span style="color:#006a44;">Respect.  </span>**
- **<span style="color:lime;">Rethink.</span>**
- **<span style="color:#006a44;">Reduce.</span>**
- **<span style="color:lime;">Reuse. </span>**
- **<span style ="color:#006a44;">Recycle.</span>**
- **<span style="color:lime;">Restore.</span>**


<span style="color:#4891d9;"><u>**Materials**</u></span>

It is during your planning phase that it is most important to think about the end-game — where will your materials end up?

<span style="color:#4891d9;">**Think**</span> about your material choices chronologically, and ask yourself:

- Where did they come from?
- How can I use them the most efficiently?
- Where will they end up when I’m done? Landfill?
- Repurposed?
- Burned?
- What’s the most environmentally friendly choice I can make?

<span style="color:#4891d9;"> Purchase or acquire</span> materials from socially and environmentally conscious sources.

Explore the options for obtaining repurposed materials in your area.

Wherever possible, consider the <span style ="color:lime;">6R</span><span style ="color:#006a44;">'s</span> first before buying new.

Although it can be more challenging to use repurposed materials, it is more  interesting and compelling to see how you can transmorph the lifecycle of an object.



<span style="color:#4891d9;"><u>**To Burn or Not to Burn?**</u></span>

If you do choose to burn your art, it’s critical you plan to avoid using toxic materials or paint that would be released into the atmosphere.

Paint, very bad to burn.

Plastics, very very bad.



<span style="color:#4891d9;"><u>**Lighting and Power**</u></span>

For your safety and the safety of others,  light your installation at night, even when it’s just a construction site during your setup phase.

In some cases, it is necessary to provide power to your installation. Rather than defaulting to gas-powered generators, look at biodiesel generators, solar, people power or other options.



<span style="color:#4891d9;"><u>**Leave No Trace**</u></span>

Construction materials contribute greatly to MOOP.

- Wood chips, splinters, nails, screws and sawdust. Yes, all of those are MOOP.
- Anything not of the farm is considered MOOP.

Bring a magnet rake with you if you’re doing metal work, including welding, grinding, screws, nails, staples — magnet rakes are a great way to clean up metal quickly and easily.

When you’re building, use tarps or other coverings to catch splinters, metal shavings and sawdust. Yes, it can be a pain to deal with, but it’s certainly better than trying to clean up wood splinters and sawdust from the ground.

Easiest rule of thumb is: **never let it hit the ground**

<span style="color:#4891d9;"><u>**Transportation**</u></span>

If you’re building a particularly large installation, you will find that your transportation costs constitute a very large chunk of your budget — especially if you’re coming from far away. Consider teaming up with other artists or theme camps to share the ride.
