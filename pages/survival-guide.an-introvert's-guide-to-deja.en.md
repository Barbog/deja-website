At times, DeJā will feel like it’s been designed for loud, confident and extroverted people. Meeting so many new people can be a bit much if you’re shy or a bit introverted (like 25% of the population), and it can be very easy to feel left out. Or it might just be too much if you’re just not feeling at the top of your game.

**Connecting with other DeJānites**

Meeting new people is one of the best parts of DeJā, but some people may find this more challenging than others, especially as several DeJāns know each other from previous years and other burner events. Luckily, there’s plenty of ways to feel more integrated.



Volunteering is one of the best ways to meet new people. Working towards a common goal as part of a team lets you meet a great variety of people without having to find ways to break the ice, while giving back to the event. Build and strike are among the best opportunities to do this. Check out our volunteers page for more ideas.

Workshops are a great way to meet likeminded people especially if you’re walking around on your own.

Your own camp is a natural place to meet new friends. Don’t be intimidated if people all seem to know each other – DeJā is one of the most friendly places you can be, so feel free to join in with groups.

Icebreaker questions can be a useful thing to have up your sleeve if you’re feeling quite nervous.
