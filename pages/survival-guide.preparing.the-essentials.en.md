​Practice self-reliance – bring everything you will need to stay healthy, comfortable and safe. Pooling resources with others can make transporting and arranging necessities much easier. Below is a list of things you should have.



**The Essentials - Highly Recommended**

- 3 to 5 liters of **water** per person per day
- For drinking, food preparation. etc.
- Water-bottle to carry around.

- Enough **food** for the duration of your stay.
- **Plastic Boxes with Lids**
- Good to store clothes or food in, especially if you forgot to close your tent if/when it is raining.
- Ensuring that your belongings are waterproof is also essential!
- **Your Own Cup, plate/bowl, fork, spoon, knife and a can opener.**
- TIP: Clip on your Cup to carry around - great for when you are gifted a drinks.
- **Camping gear**, based on your needs.

- **Tent, air-mattress, sleeping-bag.**
- **Tarp(s)**
- **Blanket(s)**
- **Flashlight,  LED light for your tent**

For your camping area:

- Bags - good for carrying with you to collect any random MOOP  as you wander around the property  so that you can do your part in Leaving a Better Trace.
- **Pocket ashtray**, if you are a smoker.
- **Torch** (LED head-torches are great, as the batteries last well and your hands are left free).
- **Bug repellent.**
- Be aware you may encounter tics
- **Sunscreen**.
- Any **toiletries and hygiene items** you might need.
- **Wet wipes** - there will be no showers (unless someone gifts one to the community).
- **Hand sanitizer.**
- **Toilet paper** for gifting to the public toilets as well as for own use.
- A basic **first aid kit** and any medicines you might need.
- **Condoms** – be prepared for finding the fern flower.
- **Earplugs** if you're a light sleeper.

**Things to gift:**

- (extra stuff from this list will do much better than trinkets as everybody forgets something).
- **All materials and tools** you require for your projects!
- **Clothing** – the temperatures can vary drastically, so the key to staying comfortable is having multiple layers.
- **Rain boots and warm socks** to keep your feet dry,
- **Sunglasses**
- **Water-resisting clothes**
- **Poncho** (bling it out)

**The Essentials - Very Good to Have**

- **Intoxicating aids**
- Because gifting is an essential part of DeJā, it is recommend to bring more then you need, to gift  to others during the event.
  NOTE: Beer is the traditional drink of choice during the Midsummer celebration.

**Exotic clothing**

- Dress up items, costumes, togas,  - whatever you feel comfortable wearing or not wearing at all.
- Furry clothing, onesies.
- Be a superhero, a unicorn, a vicar in a tutu, or a nun.  Be a fairy, an elf, a hobbit, or a racoon.
  **Remember: no glitter and feathers!!!**
- **LED or other lighting for clothes**  There are no lights once it is dark, so the easiest way to be recognised is by wearing something that emits light. Buy some form of LED lights operating on battery, and attach them to your clothes or headgear.  The more colourful the better.
