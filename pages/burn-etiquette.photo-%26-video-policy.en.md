# **Photo & Video Policy**

Many opportunities for photography will arise at DeJā,  when possible please ask permission before doing so.   If the moment you want to capture will be lost,  immediately ask after taking it.

- Find out if they will be ok with you sharing the images online or elsewhere.
- Remember, no one has a right to photograph or film you if you do not wish to be photographed.
- <span style="color:red">**No photos should be taken and published for commercial use!**</span>  (different red/ less orange)




<span style="color:gold;">**SUGGESTION**</span>:  You are at DeJā to be at DeJā, not to spend your time on (insert your social media of choice here). Please abstain from posting on social media during the days of the gathering.
