**<span class="center" style="color:gold;"><u>Tips and Hints  — Before DeJā</u></span>**

<span style="color:dodgerblue;"><u>**Plan Ahead and Prepare**</u></span>

Preparation is key to leaving a better trace. Please keep the following in mind when packing!

<span style="color:lime;"><u>**Reduce Packaging**</u></span>

Bringing in less means having less to haul out, 

For each item that you’re bringing to DeJā, think through how you’re going to dispose of it.

- Leave unnecessary packaging at home.
  - Unpack toys and camping gear you’re bringing with you.
  - Food often comes in layers of plastic and cardboard, toss out the packaging before heading to the farm.
- Choose aluminum cans over bottles, and reusable containers over either of those.

<span style="color:lime;"><u>**Thinking of Pre-cooking?**</u></span>

If you plan on cooking before coming out:

- Prepare food in sensible quantities that your group can finish at a single sitting — leftovers can quickly become a mess.
- Coordinate with your campmates as far as what you’re bringing to minimize waste.
- If you’ve found yourself with a giant pot of food and not enough campmates, invite neighbors over to finish it off.  It beats creating a wet, heavy bag of trash that has to be packed into someone’s trunk.

- <span style="color:tomato;">**Avoid**</span> packing packaging.
- Condense your items and reduce the amount of trash you will need to leave with by, removing the packaging wrappers from anything you will travel with you.
- <span style="color:tomato;">**Avoid**</span> glass – it can shatter.
- <span style="color:tomato;">**Do not**</span> bring: loose glitter, feather boas. Such items are near impossible to recover.


<span style="color:greenyellow;">**Do**</span> bring:

- **Bags** for your garbage.
- **Gloves** – pack work gloves for picking up any sharp bits.
- **Magnet** - to help pick up any metal hardware your project may have left on the ground after being burned.
- **Your own cup, bowl and eating utensils**: disposable cups, plates and cutlery are one of the biggest sources of trash at festivals. Make sure you always have an easy-to-carry cup with you to use anywhere, anytime. Be responsible for your cup.
- **SMOKERS: buy or make a portable ashtray** (a mint tin, for instance) to collect your cigarette butts and ashes.
  - **Never, ever drop the butts!**




<span style="color:greenyellow;">**Leave space**</span> in your car for taking away your trash.

If taking the bus or sharing a car, **ensure** you have a way of taking your garbage with you or arrange for its removal.



<span style="color:orange;">**Tag** </span>all of your belongings (keys, cameras, phones, etc.) you would want returned if misplaced: with your name, phone number and address.
