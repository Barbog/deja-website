Each participant that comes to DeJā is involved in this Ministry.

- Those who are native to the Baltic States should focus on reviving and introducing the Midsummer's traditions to the event.

- Any one who wishes to create an art project or host a workshop are welcome to do so. 

- Anyone who wishes to document the event is welcome to do so, but remember to ask permission before taking someone's picture or video.
