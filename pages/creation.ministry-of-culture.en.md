**MINISTRY OF CULTURE** â€“  Is responsible for reviving and introducing the Midsummer's traditions to the event, as well as for documenting the gathering.  If you are artistically inclined, have an art project or a workshop in mind, your skills are needed here!  And if you are a Latvian or reside in any of the other 2 Baltic States, you are encouraged to bring your native traditions to the event to share with our village.
