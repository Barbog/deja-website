**MINISTRY OF CULTURE** –  

Each participant that comes to DeJā is involved in this Ministry.

- Those who are native to the Baltic States should focus on reviving and introducing the Midsummer's traditions to the event.

- Any one who wishes to create an art project or host a workshop are welcome to do so.
