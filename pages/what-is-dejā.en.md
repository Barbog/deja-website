**What is DeJā?**   (header/banner- larger font for this?)

DeJā is . . .

* *Degošie Jāņi* - a Baltic Midsummer solstice celebration. 
* An autonomous gathering, inspired and guided by the ethos of the [BM](http://burningman.org/) culture.
* A donation-driven, volunteer run event and commercial free zone. No one gets paid to facilitate the event.  Nothing is for sale at this event.  We do not sell tickets to enter this gathering.
* An experiment in creativity, expression, participation and cash-free community.  Created, experienced and returned to nothing by you. 
* A  canvas for you to come create and express yourself.  
* A temporary village where you will meet a diverse, artisitic, international collective of individuals, participating to collectively co-create and conjure the magic,  In a surrounding where you will be required to exercise your self-reliance.  
* (*Latvian. verb.*)  to dance.
