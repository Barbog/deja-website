**<u>Gifting.</u>**

The economy of our community thrives on gifting instead of bartering.  We gift our time, effort and resources because the act of giving feels good. Gifts come from the heart without expectation of anything in return.

**<u>Fuck Commerce.</u>**

We have removed commercial transactions from our social environments. We choose the joy of participation and sharing over the culture of consumption. DeJā is a place where nothing is sold, traded or bartered. There are no vendors, shops or merchandise. We do not have sponsors; we do not use advertisements or any sort of marketing. By removing commercial transactions we encourage human interaction.

**<u>Co-Creation.</u>**

DeJā comes to life when we cooperate and collaborate. The strength of our community comes from working together. You will be encouraged to share and explore your own creativity and skills. We all are here to share our passions and learn from each other.

**<u>Self-Expression.</u>**

Experience the freedom to be yourself without judgment. Your individuality is one of the many gifts you can share with the community.  DeJā is an opportunity to express yourself freely, while still respecting your fellow participant’s rights and liberties. Do what you will, harm none.

**<u>Each One, Teach One.</u>**

This principle allows for the growth of the community, as well as maintaining the integrity of our culture. those familiar with it are encouraged to help integrate newcomers to the event. We all have skills that we can share with one another. DeJa is an opportunity to learn as well as to teach.  We are responsible for setting the example to those we invite to our gathering and for guiding any newcomers that we may meet.

**<u>Openness.</u>**

We welcome everyone and will include them as we wish to be included -- with respect, consideration and tolerance. However, if you blatantly disregard our code, you will be publicly shamed. 

**<u>Be Present.</u>**

Immediacy - Make now count!  Be present and seize the moment while it lasts! This is all there is, so make the most of it.  In many ways immediate experience is the most important element of our cultural values.

**<u>Self-Reliance.</u>**

You are responsible for you, mentally, physically and emotionally. We encourage each individual to discover and rely on his or her inner resources – to be self-sufficient and responsible for their own needs, safety and comfort. Other participants may share things with you, but this is not something you should rely on or expect. Be prepared, but do ask for help when needed.

**<u>Participation.</u>**

No spectators!  Get involved.  This is the foundation of our community. DeJā is what we make it. Our contributions are valuable, more so than we may realize. We are a do-ocracy, meaning if you see something that needs to be done, get to it and make it happen!

**<u>Community.</u>**

We are a diverse group of self-reliant individuals who look after each other. United by tolerance, acceptance, creative pursuits and respect. We believe that an event such as DeJā can bring such like-minded people together in order to affect positive changes, as well as forge lifetime friendships.

**<u>Environmental Consciousness.</u>**

We are a leave no trace event. Our community fosters a deep responsibility for the environment.  We are committed to leaving no physical trace or damage whenever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and leave only footprints when we leave. As often as possible we leave the places where we gather in a better, more beautiful state than when we found them. Leave a Better Trace!
