For all relationships, including friends, it’s a good idea to make some time to be together regularly, but you should also give everybody the space they need to enjoy themselves fully – including yourself! Leave your group and go for an adventure. State your wants and boundaries, and listen to your friend’s or partner’s wants.

Whether it be platonic, romantic, or somewhere in between, Here are a few tips that might help you preserve relationships  at DeJā, (from the experiences of people who have burned before)



**Take Care of Yourself**

Sounds basic, but you won't be able to help out others if you aren't in a place to care for yourself.

​It is too easy to become over stimulated. Between the people, the sights and the sounds, you will find yourself in a place where the rules have changed and few things are what they seem.

Add in a couple of days of exertion, unpredictable weather, sleep deprivation, possible dehydration and decreased appetite, and you may find yourself feeling a bit edgy. Chances are you will take it out on those people who are closest to you.

When you find yourself getting ready to pitch a hissy fit, stop. Get out of the sun. Drink some water. Eat some food. Take a nap.



**Know Your Campmates.**

<span style ="color:red;">**Avoid**</span> camping with someone who will make your stay in camp uncomfortable.

Your camp will be your home for almost a week. As such, it should be as comfortable as possible.

People who want to party all night and eat food out of a can should not camp with the people who prepare elaborate meals and do yoga every morning. You don’t want to end up taking care of a bunch of people who aren’t taking care of themselves.

<span style="color:green;">**Agree**</span> on camp responsibilities, whether you are organizing a theme camp or just camping with friends,

Theme camps require huge amounts of cooperation and effort. Everyone in your group needs to be committed to building and/or staffing your space.

Nothing will tear you apart quicker than making assumptions on what others have committed to.

Ambitious projects will quickly become forced marches when only a couple of people shoulder the load.

Make sure people know what is expected of them ahead of time, and find out how people want to contribute.

With any organized group, people tend to fall into their natural roles. It’s good to make sure everybody in your group has similar goals, and that they will pull their weight equally.

Don’t get upset when things don’t come together on the first day.

People will need time to acclimate, unwind and decompress when they arrive.

Don’t forget to factor in the unpredictable weather.

Keep in mind that some people just don’t belong at a burn.

Do yourself a favor, and leave the following people at home:

- Those who are attached to modern comforts.  Outdoor gatherings in nature, with limited access to modern comforts are not for everyone.
- Sensitive to noise.  Sometimes it gets loud. If you are sensitive to loud music, and people being up at all hours, you may want to reconsider. If you think you can manage,  plan accordingly for those times it may get intense for you.
- Those who need babysitting.  Don't be a babysitter.  If you find yourself in such a position, not only will they have a horrible time you will resent them for ruining your vacation. This is a huge issue for couples.



**Couples**

DeJā can be a challenging time for relationships, both with friends and romantic partners. Particularly with partners, it’s important to discuss a few questions in advance before you attend the event. Try to talk about expectations beforehand, as well as during the event. If you can make it through you can most likely make it through anything! Below are some pieces of advice from those who have been there:

**Some questions to consider for your partner:**

- What should we do if we have an argument?
- Do we expect to spend a large amount of time with each other every day, or will we be more independent of each other?
- Do you expect me to sleep in the same tent as you each night?
 - How do you feel about me interacting with someone who is naked?How would you feel if I wanted to get naked?

Make sure to schedule dates together and keep them.

- Whether you do so to just meet up for tea or coffee, or to wander around together.
- Take time to be with each other.
- Make your next date as soon as the last one’s over, before the glow fades.

Massage. Feet especially. Increase your tactile time to compensate for the inevitable shortage of routine relationship reassurances that playa life entails.

Treats. Flowers and chocolate, wine and cheese, whatever. The name of this game is “I Went to DeJā. but I Thought \*Only* About You.” Take care of one another. Watch to insure that enough water is going through you both. If you don’t stay hydrated, you’ll be broken up by the end of the event.

Push boundaries? Nyet! Yes DeJā is about self-expression. Does that matter to the heart? No! Even if he/she says ‘it’s ok’ now, it won’t be then, or later.

Be sure to take time with and time away from one another.

Don’t forget that you are individuals. 

- Exposure to the event has a different impact on everyone.
- One of you may be way into it, while the other might have a hard time adjusting.
- One of you might be into sitting around camp and making stuff, while the other wants to don costumes and do performance art
- Don’t be pushy and expect your partner to do the same things you want to do at every second.
- Spend all the time together you want, but leave room for yourself and your own interests, too.
- Remember that there are new friends for you to meet as well, so each of you should feel encouraged to spend time with other people as well as each other.



**Sex and the Single Burner**

There is a lot of sexual energy whirling about. Anything and everything can and will happen when you gather a bunch of people in this environment.

Figure out what you want. Love? Sex? Your wildest fantasies? It’s all there for the taking. Make sure the person across from you wants the same thing. If she or he doesn’t, there are others who do. Don’t go breakin’ no hearts.

Be respectful. Just because people are walking around naked does not necessarily mean they wish *you* were naked in a small enclosed space with them. Learn to take no for an answer, and don’t be afraid to use the “n” word yourself.

Get plenty of rest, monitor your substance intake and hydrate.

Always play safe.

Make love to the playa, and she will love you back. Become one with the sun, the stars, and the omnipresent dust.

Don’t be afraid to try new things. If there was ever a space for exploring, this is it!

Take responsibility for your own pleasure. You can find anything your little heart desires, but you have to ask for it first! If you don’t get what you want, look in the mirror

**I will be right back**

Yeah right . . .

There’s a lot to do and see, and simple tasks take much longer than you think they will.

You will get side tracked, caught up, distracted

Cut yourself, and your friends, some slack

DeJā is an experiment in temporary community. You are free to make new rules, and find different ways of relating with people. Learning more about other human beings — and yourself — is a big part of the reason we’re here.
