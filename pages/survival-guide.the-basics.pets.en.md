At this time we are open to having pets on site during the gathering. Keep in mind that there may be other animals on the farm. You are responsible for your pets' well being and cleaning up after them.

​If not having your pet with you is going to keep you from the event, then by all means, bring them with you, but please, pick up after them when they shit – we don't want to step on a hot pile of steaming crap while running around barefoot!
