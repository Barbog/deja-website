Because there are no commercial transactions ocuring at the gathering, we wish to extend this idea further to include - no payment  needed for entering the event as well.  For this reason we have removed the commercial transaction of a ticket.

We have been enabled to do so because the landowner has granted us use of his property free of charge.  Due to his generosity, it allows us to share this event with you and our global community.



​*Figure out what You love to give*
