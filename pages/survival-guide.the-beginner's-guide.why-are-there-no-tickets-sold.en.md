Seems counter intuitive to charge admission to enter a gathering where no commercial transactions occur. 

Being that Gifting is the economy at DeJā, the vision is to extend this idea further to include - free entry.  For this reason we have removed the commercial transaction of a ticket.

We have been enabled to do so because the landowner has granted us use of his property free of charge.  Due to his generosity, it allows us to share this event with you and our global community.
