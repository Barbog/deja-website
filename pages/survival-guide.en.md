**This is your Survival Guide** 

packed with important information about what to expect, what you will need and how to prepare to get the most out of the experience. For your safety and best experience, make sure you read it in its entirety BEFORE attending the event.

**READ IT...**



**PICKING UP AFTER YOURSELF**

A vital aspect of participation is to do our part in keeping trash under control. Meaning, if it isn’t part of the natural environment  it needs to be discarded in it's appropriate place – a fire pit if it is burnable, compost if it returns to the environment, recyclable where applicable, and refuse if it needs to go out with you.



**Before DeJā**

Preparation is key to leaving a better trace. Please keep this in mind when packing!

- <span style="color:red;">Avoid</span> packaging.
- <span style="color:red;">Avoid</span> glass – it can shatter.
- <span style="color:red;">Do not</span> bring: loose glitter, feather boas. Such items are impossible to recover and contaminate the environment.

<span style="color:green;">Do</span> bring:
- **Bags** for your garbage.

- **Gloves** – pack work gloves for picking up the sharp bits,

- **Magnet** - to help pick up any metal hardware your project may have left on the ground after being burned.

- **Your own cup, bowl and eating utensils**: disposable cups, plates and cutlery are one of the biggest sources of trash at festivals. Make sure you always have an easy-to-carry cup with you to use anywhere, anytime. Be responsible for your cup and keep it clean.

- **SMOKERS: buy or make a portable ashtray** (a mint tin, for instance) to collect your cigarette butts and ashes. Never, ever drop butts!

- <span style="color:green;">Leave space</span> in your car for taking away your trash. 

- If taking the bus or sharing a car, ensure you have a way of taking your garbage with you or arrange for its removal.



**During** **DeJā**

- **Never let MOOP hit the ground**.  Clean as you go.  MOOP attracts more MOOP.  When you see trash on the ground, pick it up and take it with you.

- The toilets are compost toilets.  If it’s not biodegradable, don’t put it in the hole.  This means no tampons, no trash, no cigarette butts etc.

- Ensure that the compost pile is treated correctly.  Only biodegradable food waste should be put in the compost pile.

- Separate recycling into glass, plastic, aluminum and cardboard/paper.  No trash is to be burned, except for cardboard/paper.



**Leaving DeJā**

Remember to leave enough time for yourself to help pack up, clean up and ensure that there is no evidence you were ever there.

- <span style="color:green;">Do</span> a sweep of your tent area.  If you are with a camp, do a line sweep of your camp with your campmates, making sure you cover the whole area,  picking up every single piece of MOOP.  Nothing is too small.  If it wasn’t there before you arrived, it must not be there when you leave.

- <span style="color:green;">Sort</span> your trash and recycling for drop-off at allocated sites on your way home

- If you are hauling anything that is not inside your vehicle, stop periodically and check to make sure your vehicle’s load is secured and hasn’t loosened in the wind.



**THINGS YOU SHOULD HAVE**

Practice self-reliance – bring everything you will need to stay healthy, comfortable and safe. Pooling resources with others can make transporting and arranging necessities much easier.

You Will Need to Bring the Following:

- 3-5 liters of **water** per person per day for drinking, food preparation and showering.

- Enough **food** for the duration of your stay.

- Your own **cup**, **bowl**, eating **utensils**, **knife** and a **can opener**.

- **Alcohol**, to drink or to gift.
           NOTE: Beer is the traditional drink of choice during the Midsummer celebration.

- **Camping gear**, based on your needs.
           Bear in mind that nights can get cold. 
- **tarps** or material to make raincovers/(shadecoverings) for any belongings you plan on keeping dry that you leave outside of your tent.   

- **Rubbish bags**.

- **Pocket ashtray**, if you are a smoker. or to gift.

- Eco-friendly **bug repellent**.

-  **Sunscreen**.

**VISA**

We do not sell tickets to the event. Instead if you wish to come you must apply for a visa to grant you access to DeJa. But you must submit it before May 31st, 2017. No exceptions. 

The land owner has given permission to use his property free of charge. His generosity in turn allows us a gathering place for you and our global community.

The process of filling out the visa instantly gets you involved and let's us know you have an interest in participating. Also helps us to determine how many people will be attending as well as how they plan to participate. 

The questions also help us keep balance between those who understand our culture and those who may be new to it.



**THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE WEATHER**

The only thing predictable about the weather during the midsummer is that it is unpredictable.  The event takes place on a hemp farm, which is located deep in the country. City folks are highly advised to dress for the weather! Temperatures will most likely fluctuate between the low 10s and low 30s. Also, be prepared for rain! Ponchos and rain boots are highly recommended.  Warm clothing is warmly suggested, especially for the nights.

Bring eco-friendly bug repellant for mosquitoes and ticks.	


**KITCHEN**


It is of the most importance that you use the hand washing station before entering the kitchen.

When you are in the kitchen remind anyone who enters the preparing area to wash their hands. 

The kitchen is for communal use. If you wish to cook, you can use the facilities, and if you wish to help keep it clean you are also welcome to do so.  Please abide by the posted rules you will see in the kitchen area. 

You are responsible for cleaning up what you dirty and for washing your personal utensils and dishes!


**WATER**

There is no drinking water at DeJā.  You must bring enough water with you to last the entire event. We recommend you bring at least 3-5 liters of water per person per day for drinking, food preparation and showering.


**FIRE**

- If you didn't create it don't set it on fire.  You only have the right to burn the art that you have created!

- If you are burning art, ensure you keep a perimeter whose diameter is no less than 2.5 times the height of your installation.  Clear away anything that may be flamable that is near the vicinity of your piece. Be prepared to control your fire. 

- Absolutely NO SMOKING in the barn, it is highly flammable!

- No fireworks!

- If playing with fire toys, please be mindful of your surroundings and be prepared to put out any accidental fires that you may cause.

- PLEASE RESPECT THE FIRE RULES! DON’T ENDANGER YOURSELF, YOUR NEIGHBORS, THE ENVIRONMENT, THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES OR THE FUTURE OF DeJā BY GOING AGAINST THESE SIMPLE RULES.


**SOUND**

You may want to sleep while others are partying, so we suggest that you bring earplugs, as the sound travels far on the property. Also, consider camping away from the dance areas or sound systems, especially if you are sensitive to noise or have small children. 


**23rd OF JUNE**

We have chosen the dates to coincide with the Baltic Midsummer solstice festivities for several reasons – to share this magical time of year and the local traditions with all of those who attend from outside the Baltics and to add the element of a burn to the national holiday.

On the 23rd we are asking the participants to unplug from the sound systems and go acoustic and tune into the earth.
