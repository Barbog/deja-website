(new page)

​	**Why do i need a Visa?**

​		DeJā is a private gathering celebrated on private property, 		open to those who learn about the event and 	make their way to the property.  The visas help us determine how many people will be attending and how they plan to participate. This in turn helps us with the logistics of the infrastructure as well as providing a census. The applications also help us keep balance between those who understand our culture and those who may be new to it.

​		So if you wish to particiapate, start with the process of filling out the visa.  Your visa application gets your name on the entry list. 

​		Not on the list? No entry. No exceptions! 							  	

​				Be on time and fill yours out!

(new page)

​	**Why are there not tickets sold?**

​		First and foremost, being that there are no commercial transactions ocuring at the gathering, we wish to push this idea further and remove the commercial transaction of a ticket sale as well.

​		Second, we have been enabled to do so because the landowner has granted us use of his property free of charge.  Due to his generosity, it allows us to share this event with you and our global community.

(new page)

​	**Environment/Weather**

​		The only thing predictable about the weather during the midsummer is that it is unpredictable. The event takes place on a farm, which is located deep in the country. City folks are highly advised to dress for the weather! 

​		Temperatures will most likely fluctuate between the low 10s during the nights and high 30s during the day. 

​		**Be prepared for rain!**  Ponchos and rain boots are highly recommended.

​		Warm clothing is suggested, especially during the nights.

​		Consider layering your clothes.

​		Bring eco-friendly bug repellant for mosquitoes and ticks.		 

​		Don't forget your sunglasses and sunscreen.



(new page)

​	**Water**

​		There is no drinking water at DeJā. You must bring enough water with you to last the entire event. We recommend you bring at least 3 to 5 liters of water per person per day for drinking and food preparation.



(new page)

​	**Electricity**

​		There is limited electricity which can be used at the farm. This is being used for the kitchen and for the main sound stage. We do not wish to create an expense for the farm with our use of their power, so it is higly suggested that you supply your own power if you will be needing some for your camp, installation or sound stage. 

​		You are encouraged to lead and organize the rental of a generator, if you must, but if you do, please find a way to muffle the noise, so the sounds of nature are not drowned out by the noise these create.    

​	Pro Tip:  if you can generate power in a cleaner or greener way for your purposes, we highly encourage you to go this route.

(new page)

​	**Sound** 

​		You may want to sleep while others are partying, so we suggest that you bring earplugs, as the sound travels far on the property

​		There is a “quiet camping” area on the property, so you may consider camping away from the dance areas or sound systems, especially if you are sensitive to noise or have small children.

​		DeJā provides one sound system for the event, you are encouraged to bring your own or collaborate and create a sound camp of your own with other participants. Be thoughtful of your neighbors.

​		We have a casual curfew, meaning that between the hours of 6:00 and 9:00 music will be turned down/off to allow people to sleep if they so choose to. 



(new page)

​	**Cell Phones/Tablets/PCs**

​		We encourage you to turn off your devices and be present.  		

​			You are at DeJā to be at DeJā

​		Because of our location and proximity to the border, we have poor wi-fi/cellular  access on the property and phones are known to roam between both countries networks attempting to find the best signal.  We hghly recommend that your phone is set to airplane mode so you don't roam. 

​	Pro Tip:  Turn off your phone and put it away until you leave the property!

​		We ask that you do not post anything about DeJā to FB or other social media sites during the days while you are at the gathering. Stay present!

​	**Fires and Safety Rules**

​		1. Absolutely NO SMOKING inside of the barn, it is highly flammable!  If you see someone light up in the barn, kindly ask them to step outside to smoke.

​		2. No fireworks! 

​		3. If you are planning on burning your art, ensure that you keep a fire perimeter whose diameter is equal to 2.5 times the height of your installation and be prepared to control your fire.

​		4. Remember – you only have the right to burn the art that you have created!

​		5. If playing with fire toys, please be mindful of your surroundings and be prepared to put out any accidental fires that you may cause.

​		6. The Communal kitchen is the designated area to cook, if you choose to build your own fire, please be mindful of the area and be ready to control it, if it gets out of hand.  

​		7. Be Smart!  Don't endanger yourself, your neighbors, the environment, the local communities or the future of DeJā by ignoring or going against these simple rules. 

​		**PLEASE RESPECT THE FIRE RULES!** 



(new page)

​	**Communal Kitchen**

​		At DeJā we have created a kitchen for communal use to minimize the weight load of those traveling from afar,  with the intention that the participants have more time to dedicate to their art installations. and projects.  If you wish to cook, you can use the facilities, and you are encouraged to help keep the area clean.  Please abide by the posted rules you will see in the kitchen area. If there is something you like to use to cook  and rather not live without,  bring it with you. 

​		NOTICE:  It is of the most importance that you use the hand washing station before entering the kitchen area to prevent the entire camp from catching a stomach virus. 

​	Remember:

​	Please use the handwashing station before entering the kitchen.

​	Please ensure that anyone working with you in the kitchen does the same. Remind anyone who enters the preparing area to wash their hands. 

​	Rotate and change the wet station as needed while you are using the kitchen.

​	Clean up whatever you dirty. You are responsible for cleaning up what you dirty and for washing your personal utensils and dishes.

​	If you see that something that needs to be done, please take it upon yourself to see that it gets done.  



​	One other thing:

​	There is an option to purchase into the meal plan pre-event.  If you chose this, a portion of your  meal dues will be used to feed the volunteers at the different posts throughout the event.

​	**Donations/Contributions**

​		These come in the form of time, energy, resources or funds. Everyone involved in the gathering contributes in the best way they can, thus benefiting the entire community. Even though we don’t condone monetary transactions during the event, expenses associated with producing the event do arise. We ask you to consider contributing in a way in which you feel most comfortable doing so, preferably before the visa submission deadline, if possible.   If you decide to contribute financially, you are well within your rights to let us know how you wish for your monetary contribution to be used.

​		 If we have enough donations to gift grants, then these grants will be distributed to those participants who submit their request for a grant in writing. (enter email as to where to send request) In it you should include the cost of creating your piece.  The amount of the grant will be based on the donations we receive this year and how many grant requests we receive.

​	**Personal Health and Safety**

​		Although DeJā is on a relatively safe location, use common sense when exploring, wandering, climbing, etc.

​		At times DeJā can be potentially challenging, weather wise and emotionally,  come prepared to confront the challenges and be responsible for your own survival. 

​		It is dark on the farm when away from the lit up areas— stay safe: don't be a darkwad and choose to illuminate yourself, your camp area and your artwork at night. 

​		You are responsible for You.

​		Bring any and all medications that you may need to use. 



(new page)

​	**Children/Minors**

​		Anyone under the age of 18 needs to be accompanied by a guardian in order to enter as DeJā is an adult-oriented event.  DeJā does not dictate what is appropriate for your kids, nor assumes responsibility for the safety of your children – as their parents, you do.



(new page)

​	**Pets** 

​		At this time we are open to having pets on site during the gathering. Keep in mind that there may be other animals on the farm. You are responsible for your pets' well being and cleaning up after them. 

​		  If not having your pet with you is going to keep you from the event, then by all means, bring them with you, but please, pick up after them when they shit – we don't want to step on a hot pile of steaming crap while running around barefoot!

​	**23rd of June** - Jāņi, Līgo

​		We have chosen the dates of the local midsummer solstice festivities to coincide with our event for several reasons:

​			To share this magical time and our local traditions with all of those who attend the event from outside the Baltic States.

​			To add the element of a burn to this national holiday.

​			To share the burn experience with the local community as well as those burn curious who have yet to experience our culture

​		On the 23rd we are asking the participants to unplug from the sound systems and tune into the earth and consider playing acoustic sets instead. 





(new page)

​	**Lost Property/Lost and Found**

​		If you find something that appears to belong to someone else, ask around in the immediate vicinity. If no one claims it, take it to the Info Center.  Similarly, if you have lost something, then go ask at the Info Center.

​	**Latvian Law** 

​		All participants are reminded that despite going to the farm to celebrate DeJā, you are bound by the local and national laws of Latvia. Please check the local laws before you leave home.

​		If you are planning on driving while in Latvia, you should check that your insurance and license are valid in Latvia. You can get advice on this from the Latvian embassy in your country. 

​		During this time of year, there are many checkpoints on the roads. Please, do not drive while intoxicated! 

​		DeJā does not condone illegal drug use and strongly advises against individuals taking risks with their health out in the open country. 

​		Please bear in mind the limited medical support on site before you consider placing yourself at risk.





**PICKING UP AFTER YOURSELF**

A vital aspect of participation is to do our part in keeping trash under control. Meaning, if it isn’t part of the natural environment  it needs to be discarded in it's appropriate place – a fire pit if it is burnable, compost if it returns to the environment, recyclable where applicable, and refuse if it needs to go out with you.



**Before DeJā**

Preparation is key to leaving a better trace. Please keep this in mind when packing!

- <span style="color:red;">Avoid</span> packaging.
- <span style="color:red;">Avoid</span> glass – it can shatter.
- <span style="color:red;">Do not</span> bring: loose glitter, feather boas. Such items are impossible to recover and contaminate the environment.

<span style="color:green;">Do</span> bring:
- **Bags** for your garbage.

- **Gloves** – pack work gloves for picking up the sharp bits,

- **Magnet** - to help pick up any metal hardware your project may have left on the ground after being burned.

- **Your own cup, bowl and eating utensils**: disposable cups, plates and cutlery are one of the biggest sources of trash at festivals. Make sure you always have an easy-to-carry cup with you to use anywhere, anytime. Be responsible for your cup and keep it clean.

- **SMOKERS: buy or make a portable ashtray** (a mint tin, for instance) to collect your cigarette butts and ashes. Never, ever drop butts!

- <span style="color:green;">Leave space</span> in your car for taking away your trash. 

- If taking the bus or sharing a car, ensure you have a way of taking your garbage with you or arrange for its removal.



**During** **DeJā**

- **Never let MOOP hit the ground**.  Clean as you go.  MOOP attracts more MOOP.  When you see trash on the ground, pick it up and take it with you.

- The toilets are compost toilets.  If it’s not biodegradable, don’t put it in the hole.  This means no tampons, no trash, no cigarette butts etc.

- Ensure that the compost pile is treated correctly.  Only biodegradable food waste should be put in the compost pile.

- Separate recycling into glass, plastic, aluminum and cardboard/paper.  No trash is to be burned, except for cardboard/paper.



**Leaving DeJā**

Remember to leave enough time for yourself to help pack up, clean up and ensure that there is no evidence you were ever there.

- <span style="color:green;">Do</span> a sweep of your tent area.  If you are with a camp, do a line sweep of your camp with your campmates, making sure you cover the whole area,  picking up every single piece of MOOP.  Nothing is too small.  If it wasn’t there before you arrived, it must not be there when you leave.

- <span style="color:green;">Sort</span> your trash and recycling for drop-off at allocated sites on your way home

- If you are hauling anything that is not inside your vehicle, stop periodically and check to make sure your vehicle’s load is secured and hasn’t loosened in the wind.
