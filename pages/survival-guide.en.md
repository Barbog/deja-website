(new page)

​	**What should i expect?**

​		Nothing. If you don't bring it with you, or make it happen, it won't be there.

​		

(new page)

​	**Why do i need a Visa?**

​		DeJā is a private gathering celebrated on private property, 		open to those who learn about the event and 	make their way to the property.  The visas help us determine how many people will be attending and how they plan to participate. This in turn helps us with the logistics of the infrastructure as well as providing a census. The applications also help us keep balance between those who understand our culture and those who may be new to it.

​		So if you wish to particiapate, start with the process of filling out the visa.  Your visa application gets your name on the entry list. 

​		Not on the list? No entry. No exceptions! 							  	

​				Be on time and fill yours out!

(new page)

​	**Why are there not tickets sold?**

​		Being that there are no commercial transactions ocuring at the gathering, we wish to push this idea further and remove the commercial transaction of a ticket sale as well.

​		We have been enabled to do so because the landowner has granted us use of his property free of charge.  Due to his generosity, it allows us to share this event with you and our global community.

(new page)

​	**Environment/Weather**

​		The only thing predictable about the weather during the midsummer is that it is unpredictable. The event takes place on a farm, which is located deep in the country. City folks are highly advised to dress for the weather! 

​		Temperatures will most likely fluctuate between the low 10s during the nights and high 30s during the day. 

​		**Be prepared for rain!**  Ponchos and rain boots are highly recommended.

​		Warm clothing is suggested, especially during the nights.

​		Consider layering your clothes.

​		Bring eco-friendly bug repellant for mosquitoes and ticks.		 

​		Don't forget your sunglasses and sunscreen.



(new page)

​	**Water**

​		There is no drinking water at DeJā. You must bring enough water with you to last the entire event. We recommend you bring at least 3 to 5 liters of water per person per day for drinking and food preparation.



(new page)

​	**Electricity**

​		There is limited electricity which can be used at the farm. This is being used for the kitchen and for the main sound stage. We do not wish to create an expense for the farm with our use of their power, so it is higly suggested that you supply your own power if you will be needing some for your camp, installation or sound stage. 

​		You are encouraged to lead and organize the rental of a generator, if you must, but if you do, please find a way to muffle the noise, so the sounds of nature are not drowned out by the noise these create.    

​	Pro Tip:  if you can generate power in a cleaner or greener way for your purposes, we highly encourage you to go this route.

(new page)

​	**Sound** 

​		You may want to sleep while others are partying, so we suggest that you bring earplugs, as the sound travels far on the property

​		There is a “quiet camping” area on the property, so you may consider camping away from the dance areas or sound systems, especially if you are sensitive to noise or have small children.

​		DeJā provides one sound system for the event, you are encouraged to bring your own or collaborate and create a sound camp of your own with other participants. Be thoughtful of your neighbors.

​		We have a casual curfew, meaning that between the hours of 6:00 and 9:00 music will be turned down/off to allow people to sleep if they so choose to. 



(new page)

​	**Cell Phones/Tablets/PCs**

​		We encourage you to turn off your devices and be present.  		

​			You are at DeJā to be at DeJā

​		Because of our location and proximity to the border, we have poor wi-fi/cellular  access on the property and phones are known to roam between both countries networks attempting to find the best signal.  We hghly recommend that your phone is set to airplane mode so you don't roam. 

​	Pro Tip:  Turn off your phone and put it away until you leave the property!

​		We ask that you do not post anything about DeJā to FB or other social media sites during the days while you are at the gathering. Stay present!

(new page)

​	**Fires and Safety Rules**

​		1. Absolutely NO SMOKING inside of the barn, it is highly flammable!  If you see someone light up in the barn, kindly ask them to step outside to smoke.

​		2. No fireworks! 

​		3. If you are planning on burning your art, ensure that you keep a fire perimeter whose diameter is equal to 2.5 times the height of your installation and be prepared to control your fire.

​		4. Remember – you only have the right to burn the art that you have created!

​		5. If playing with fire toys, please be mindful of your surroundings and be prepared to put out any accidental fires that you may cause.

​		6. The Communal kitchen is the designated area to cook, if you choose to build your own fire, please be mindful of the area and be ready to control it, if it gets out of hand.  

​		7. Be Smart!  Don't endanger yourself, your neighbors, the environment, the local communities or the future of DeJā by ignoring or going against these simple rules. 

​		**PLEASE RESPECT THE FIRE RULES!** 



(new page)

​	**Communal Kitchen**

​		At DeJā we have created a kitchen for communal use to minimize the weight load of those traveling from afar,  with the intention that the participants have more time to dedicate to their art installations. and projects.  If you wish to cook, you can use the facilities, and you are encouraged to help keep the area clean.  Please abide by the posted rules you will see in the kitchen area. If there is something you like to use to cook  and rather not live without,  bring it with you. 

​		NOTICE:  It is of the most importance that you use the hand washing station before entering the kitchen area to prevent the entire camp from catching a stomach virus. 

​	Remember:

​	Please use the handwashing station before entering the kitchen.

​	Please ensure that anyone working with you in the kitchen does the same. Remind anyone who enters the preparing area to wash their hands. 

​	Rotate and change the wet station as needed while you are using the kitchen.

​	Clean up whatever you dirty. You are responsible for cleaning up what you dirty and for washing your personal utensils and dishes.

​	If you see that something that needs to be done, please take it upon yourself to see that it gets done.  



​	One other thing:

​	There is an option to purchase into the meal plan pre-event.  If you chose this, a portion of your  meal dues will be used to feed the volunteers at the different posts throughout the event.  



(new page)

​	**Donations/Contributions**

​		These come in the form of time, energy, resources or funds. Everyone involved in the gathering contributes in the best way they can, thus benefiting the entire community. Even though we don’t condone monetary transactions during the event, expenses associated with producing the event do arise. We ask you to consider contributing in a way in which you feel most comfortable doing so, preferably before the visa submission deadline, if possible.   If you decide to contribute financially, you are well within your rights to let us know how you wish for your monetary contribution to be used.

​		 If we have enough donations to gift grants, then these grants will be distributed to those participants who submit their request for a grant in writing. (enter email as to where to send request) In it you should include the cost of creating your piece.  The amount of the grant will be based on the donations we receive this year and how many grant requests we receive. 



(new page)

​	**Personal Health and Safety**

​		Although DeJā is on a relatively safe location, use common sense when exploring, wandering, climbing, etc.

​		At times DeJā can be potentially challenging, weather wise and emotionally,  come prepared to confront the challenges and be responsible for your own survival. 

​		It is dark on the farm when away from the lit up areas— stay safe: don't be a darkwad and choose to illuminate yourself, your camp area and your artwork at night. 

​		You are responsible for You.

​		Bring any and all medications that you may need to use. 



(new page)

​	**Children/Minors**

​		Anyone under the age of 18 needs to be accompanied by a guardian in order to enter as DeJā is an adult-oriented event.  DeJā does not dictate what is appropriate for your kids, nor assumes responsibility for the safety of your children – as their parents, you do.



(new page)

​	**Pets** 

​		At this time we are open to having pets on site during the gathering. Keep in mind that there may be other animals on the farm. You are responsible for your pets' well being and cleaning up after them. 

​		  If not having your pet with you is going to keep you from the event, then by all means, bring them with you, but please, pick up after them when they shit – we don't want to step on a hot pile of steaming crap while running around barefoot!



(new page)

​	**23rd of June** - Jāņi, Līgo

​		We have chosen the dates of the local midsummer solstice festivities to coincide with our event for several reasons:

​			To share this magical time and our local traditions with all of those who attend the event from outside the Baltic States.

​			To add the element of a burn to this national holiday.

​			To share the burn experience with the local community as well as those burn curious who have yet to experience our culture

​			To share the local midsummer traditions with those who travel from abroad to celebrate with us. 

​		On the 23rd we are asking the participants to unplug from the sound systems and tune into the earth and consider playing acoustic sets instead. 





(new page)

​	**Lost Property/Lost and Found**

​		If you find something that appears to belong to someone else, ask around in the immediate vicinity. If no one claims it, take it to the Info Center.  Similarly, if you have lost something, then go ask at the Info Center.

​	**Generators**  



(new page)

​	**Latvian Law** 

​		All participants are reminded that despite going to the farm to celebrate DeJā, you are bound by the local and national laws of Latvia. Please check the local laws before you leave home.

​		If you are planning on driving while in Latvia, you should check that your insurance and license are valid in Latvia. You can get advice on this from the Latvian embassy in your country. 

​		During this time of year, there are many checkpoints on the roads. Please, do not drive while intoxicated! 

​		DeJā does not condone illegal drug use and strongly advises against individuals taking risks with their health out in the open country. 

​		Please bear in mind the limited medical support on site before you consider placing yourself at risk.

- **The Essentials - Very Good to Have**

- **Intoxicating aids**

  - Because gifting is an essential part of DeJā, it is recommend to bring more then you need, to gift  to others during the event.

    NOTE: Beer is the traditional drink of choice during the Midsummer celebration.

- **Environmental Consciousness**

  - A vital aspect of participation is to do our part in keeping trash under control. Meaning, if it isn’t part of the natural environment, it needs to be discarded in its' appropriate place – a fire pit if it is burnable, compost if it returns to the environment, recyclable where applicable, and trash if it needs to go out with you. Below are some tips as to what you can do to help.

- **Leave No Trace!**

  - Practicing a Leave No Trace Ethic is simple: 

    - Leave the place you visit the same or better than you found it; so that others – human and animal – can enjoy the land the rest of the year.
    - Leave No Trace is NOT something you do only at the end of your stay at DeJā. 

  - Leave No Trace  starts before you head out to the farm because that’s when you develop your plan,

    -  Pre-planning is when you carefully consider any items you’re bringing that could become MOOP.
    -  Set your end-of-event line sweep plan and schedule. 

  - Leave No Trace continues when you get to the farm.

  - It continues into your construction process, when you place tarps below construction projects to catch stray nails, wood chips, metal shavings and sawdust.

    - Pick up supplies like magnet rakes and other LNT supplies, 

  - Leave No Trace takes place every moment of the event, 

    - Never let it hit the ground.
    - MOOP as you go,  pick up other random MOOP. 
    - Carry a MOOP bag with you, so that you can play your collective part of this community.

  - It is up to each of us to care for the longevity of our event by remaining aware of our environment, and not leaving any trash anywhere on the property.

  **Tips and Hints**

  ​

  **Before DeJā**

  ​	Preparation is key to leaving a better trace. Please keep this in mind when packing!

  ​

  - <span style="color:red;">Avoid</span> packing packaging.
    - Condense your items and reduce the amount of trash you will need to leave with by, removing the packaging wrappers from anything you will travel with.
  - <span style="color:red;">Avoid</span> glass – it can shatter.
  - <span style="color:red;">Do not</span> bring: loose glitter, feather boas. Such items are near impossible to recover.

  <span style="color:green;">Do</span> bring:

  - **Bags** for your garbage.

  - **Gloves** – pack work gloves for picking up any sharp bits.

  - **Magnet** - to help pick up any metal hardware your project may have left on the ground after being burned.

  - **Your own cup, bowl and eating utensils**: disposable cups, plates and cutlery are one of the biggest sources of trash at festivals. Make sure you always have an easy-to-carry cup with you to use anywhere, anytime. Be responsible for your cup.

  - **SMOKERS: buy or make a portable ashtray** (a mint tin, for instance) to collect your cigarette butts and ashes. 

    - **Never, ever drop butts!**

  - <span style="color:green;">Leave space</span> in your car for taking away your trash. 

    - If taking the bus or sharing a car, ensure you have a way of taking your garbage with you or arrange for its removal.

  - <span style="color:orange;">**Tag** </span>all of your belongings (keys, cameras, phones, etc.) you would want returned if misplaced: with your name, phone number and address.

  - **Plan Ahead and Prepare**

    - For each item that you’re bringing to DeJā, think through how you’re going to dispose of it.
    - Have your camp tear-down well planned and practiced. 
    - Plan to send trash off the farm with campmates as they leave the event.

  - **Reduce Packaging**

    - Bringing in less means having less to haul out. 
    - Leave unnecessary packaging at home. 
    - Food often comes in layers of plastic and cardboard, toss out the packaging before heading to the farm.
    - Unpack toys and camping gear you’re bringing with you. 
      - Doing so before arriving  spares you the hassle of bringing back styrofoam packing, shrink wrap, etc. 
      - Choose aluminum cans over bottles, and reusable containers over either of those. 

  - **Rethink Your Food Portions**

    - If you plan on pre-cooking before coming out:

      - Prepare food in sensible quantities your group can finish at a single sitting — leftovers can quickly become a mess.

      - Coordinate with your campmates as far as what you’re bringing to minimize waste. 

      - If you’ve found yourself with a giant pot of chili and not enough campmates, invite neighbors over to finish it off. It beats creating a wet, heavy bag of trash that has to be packed into someone’s trunk.

        ​

        ​

  **During** **DeJā**

  <span style="color:green;">**Be Aware </span> of Very Small Items**

  No Trace really does mean no trace.

  - Be conscious of spare nails or smaller trash particles that may be dismissed as too small for trash including: hair, matches, cigarette butts, feathers, zip ties. 
  - After you pick up your trash to carry home, do a last-minute check of your site for cigarette butts, gum wrappers, etc. because many of those will be hidden under tarps, tents and vehicles.


- <span style="color:red;">**Never **</span>let MOOP hit the ground.  Clean as you go.  MOOP attracts more MOOP.  
    - When you see trash on the ground, pick it up and take it with you.
- Ensure that the compost pile is treated correctly.  Only biodegradable food waste should be put in the compost pile.
    - Food waste such as peanut shells, orange peels and eggshells are also trash. Dispose of these in the compost.
- <span style="color:green;">**Separate**</span> recycling into glass, plastic, aluminum and cardboard/paper.  
    - No trash is to be burned, except for cardboard/paper.
- The toilets are compost toilets.  If it’s not biodegradable, don’t put it in the hole.  This means no tampons, no trash, no cigarette butts etc.
    - **Do Not Use the Farm as Your Toilet**
      - This is unacceptable, unsanitary, and just plain gross the morning after if several hundred people are using the farm in this way. 
      - If you bring a pet with you, make certain to remove their waste just as you would your own.
    - **Minimize Fire Impacts**
      - Keep in mind that most non-natural materials (rugs, polyester, plastic, treated wood) are toxic when burned.
    - **Respect Wildlife**
      - If you happen to come across any wild life that wanders into camp, please Do not harass it. 





(new page)

  **Leaving DeJā**

-   <span style="color:green;">Do</span> a MOOP sweep of your tent area.  

    - As you’re packing your camp, have campmates walk repeatedly around your site picking up anything and everything that’s not part of the farm.

    <span style="color:orange;">**TIP**</span> : Doing this periodically, through the week, will make it easier.**

-   Do a line sweep of your camp with your campmates, making sure you cover the whole area,  picking up every single piece of MOOP.  

    - Nothing is too small.  If it wasn’t there before you arrived, it must not be there when you leave.
    - If half of your campmates will have left before you, the folks left behind are going to have a lot more work to do. 
    - <span style="color:green;">Remember</span> to leave enough time to help pack up, clean up and ensure that there is no evidence you were ever there. 

-   Sort your trash and recycling for drop-off at allocated sites on your way home.

    - <span style="color:red;">**Do not**</span> dump your trash anywhere in neighboring communities that is not a designated trash or recycling site.
    - <span style="color:green;">**Take** your trash with you! And if you have space, please take an orphan bag if you see one at the gate on your way out. 

-   If you are hauling anything that is not inside your vehicle, stop periodically and check to make sure your vehicle’s load is secured and hasn’t loosened in the wind.



<span style="color:red;">**Don’t Rush**</span> Packing and Departure

Don’t stress to hurry home. 

Long-term exposure to the burn may fatigue your body and impair decision-making. 

When under pressure, we are all likely to make rushed decisions, miss details and leave things behind. If you have to catch a plane, make sure to start packing up even earlier than you think they have to, so you aren’t tempted to leave before fully clearing your site.

<span style="color:green;">**Making Your Camp Green**</span>

Whether you represent a massive village, a medium-sized theme camp, or stand alone as a camp of one, there are many ways that you can make your camping experience at DeJā more environmenally friendly

Learn and consider the 6 R’s 

​		Respect,  Rethink,  Reduce

 						Reuse,  Recycle,  Restore

.Keep these in mind from the beginning through to the end of your DeJā experience.



(new page)

**Transportation**

Coming Alone?<span style ="color:orange;"> Consider</span> ride sharing to reduce the number of cars going to and from the farm. You can find likely candidates through our car share channel on Slack.

Do you have a lot of stuff to bring for yourself and/or for your camp? Coming from far away? Maybe you could band together with other folks near you.

​	<span style ="color:orange;">Consider</span> inflatable furniture, or a metal-framed futon, which can be disassembled to fit compactly in a car and reused at another event.

It will save you money and will reduce the gas you will use, and the emissions and pollution you’ll create. 

**Materials**

Think about materials you use to build your camp:

Rather than using materials you might use once and discard,<span style="color:orange;"> consider </span>designing camp structures and elements that can be assembled, disassembled and reused year after year.

Rather than buying new construction materials: 

- <span style ="color:orange;">***Consider***</span> using recycled, repurposed or reclaimed materials.

- Do some research and explore the options for obtaining repurposed materials in your area.  Dumpster dive.

- Look through the classifieds for someone that might have a dome or other infrastructure item they’re hoping to get rid of.

  ​

If you must burn elements of your camp, 

- <span style ="color:red;">do not </span>paint or treat them with toxic materials that would be released into the atmosphere when burned. 


- And, if you must burn, <span style ="color:orange;">consider </span>purchasing carbon offsets to counter what you’re putting into the atmosphere. 

At the very least, don’t bring anything to the farm without ensuring that you know how it is going to leave. 



(new page)

 **Energy and Lighting**

Power and light are an integral part of almost every camp. Many people take it for granted that you may have to run a generator and lights to illuminate your space. 

​	<span style ="color:orange;">Consider </span>a bio-fuel generator rather than a gas one. 

<span style ="color:orange;">Consider Sharing</span> generator power with your neighbors!

please don’t use glow sticks! 

- These are one-time use.
- They don’t last long.
- They aren’t recyclable. 
- They add toxic materials to landfills.

When you need to illuminate yourself, <span style ="color:orange;">consider</span> a battery or solar-powered LED light string, EL wire, or reflective tape.



(new page)

<span style ="color:green;">**Making Your Art Green**</span>

First,  thank you for contributing art to DeJā. Art is at the center of our community.  This section can give you some valuable insights and shifts in perspective that will help you make your art more environmentally friendly.

As a first step, we recommend the 6 R’s: 

<span style ="color:green;">**Respect.  Rethink.  Reduce.   Reuse.  Recycle.  Restore.**</span>

 If you keep these ideas at the forefront of your consciousness while you conceive and create your art installation, you are sure to be as green as you can get.

**Materials**

It is during your planning phase that it is most important to think about the end-game — where will your materials end up?

<span style ="color:lavender;">Think </span>about your material choices chronologically, and ask yourself: 

- Where did they come from?
- How can I use them the most efficiently?
- Where will they end up when I’m done? Landfill? 
- Repurposed? 
- Burned? 
- What’s the most environmentally friendly choice I can make? 

Purchase or acquire materials from socially and environmentally conscious sources. 

Explore the options for obtaining repurposed materials in your area.

Wherever possible, reuse, repurpose and recycle materials, rather than buying new. 

Although it can be more challenging to use repurposed materials, it is more  interesting and compelling to see how you can transmorph the lifecycle of an object. 

**To Burn or Not to Burn?**

If you do choose to burn your art, it’s critical you plan to avoid using toxic materials or paint that would be released into the atmosphere. 

​	Paint, very bad to burn. 

​	Plastics, very very bad. 



**Lighting and Power**

For your safety and the safety of others,  light your installation at night, even when it’s just a construction site during your setup phase. 

​	Hint: glow sticks are bad bad bad.

In many cases, it’s necessary to provide power to your installation. Rather than defaulting to gas-powered generators, look at biodiesel generators, solar, people power or other options.



**Leave No Trace** 

Construction materials contribute greatly to MOOP,

​	Wood chips, splinters, nails, screws and sawdust. Yes, all of those are MOOP. 	

​	Anything not of the farm is considered MOOP, folks. 

​	Bring a magnet rake with you if you’re doing metal work, including welding, grinding, screws, nails, staples — magnet rakes are a great way to clean up metal quickly and easily.

When you’re building, use tarps or other coverings to catch splinters, metal shavings and sawdust. Yes, it can be a pain to deal with, but it’s certainly better than trying to clean up wood splinters and sawdust from the ground. 

​	Easiest rule of thumb is: **never let it hit the ground**

​	and (like in any good shop or kitchen) clean as you go.

**Transportation**

​	If you’re building a particularly large installation, you will find that your transportation costs constitute a very large chunk of your budget — especially if you’re coming from far away. Consider teaming up with other artists or theme camps to share the ride.



**Getting There**

You will receive directions to the farm, after you have applied for your visa. 

​	Do not share this with anyone other than those riding with you.

The closest Airport is Rīga International (RIX), located roughly 80km from the property.

Vilnius is about a 3 hour drive to the farm.

need a ride? We have a slack channel dedicated for ride shares.

**Leaving**

You are allowed to leave DeJā during the week. However, we suggest that you don't. 

​	When you leave, you pop your bubble, by exposing yourself to the default world.

​	When people leave, it usually takes them time to get back in to the zone when they return to DeJā, which also affects others. 

​	Put your full focus on living in our imaginary land for the whole week. You have 51 weeks a year to live in the default world.

We encourage you to leave on Sunday, after cleanup. We encourage you to take your garbage with you, and if you can fit one extra bag (or more) please take it with you and dispose of it properly.



**Relationship Survival Guide**

For all relationships, including friends, it’s a good idea to make some time to be together regularly, but you should also give everybody the space they need to enjoy themselves fully – including yourself! Leave your group and go for an adventure. State your wants and boundaries, and listen to your friend’s or partner’s wants. 

Whether it be platonic, romantic, or somewhere in between, Here are a few tips that might help you preserve relationships  at DeJā, (from the experiences of people who have burned before)

**Take Care of Yourself **

​	Sounds basic, but you won't be able to help out others if you aren't in a place to care for yourself.

​	It is too easy to become over stimulated. Between the people, the sights and the sounds, you will find yourself in a place where the rules have changed and few things are what they seem. 

​	Add in a couple of days of exertion, unpredictable weather, sleep deprivation, possible dehydration and decreased appetite, and you may find yourself feeling a bit edgy. Chances are you will take it out on those people who are closest to you.

When you find yourself getting ready to pitch a hissy fit, stop. Get out of the sun. Drink some water. Eat some food. Take a nap. 

**Know Your Campmates.**

<span style ="color:red;">**Avoid**</span> camping with someone who will make your stay in camp uncomfortable.

​	Your camp will be your home for almost a week. As such, it should be as comfortable as possible.

​	People who want to party all night and eat food out of a can should not camp with the people who prepare elaborate meals and do yoga every morning. You don’t want to end up taking care of a bunch of people who aren’t taking care of themselves.

<span style="color:green;">**Agree**</span> on camp responsibilities, whether you are organizing a theme camp or just camping with friends, 

​	Theme camps require huge amounts of cooperation and effort. Everyone in your group needs to be committed to building and/or staffing your space.

​	 Nothing will tear you apart quicker than making assumptions on what others have committed to. 

​	Ambitious projects will quickly become forced marches when only a couple of people shoulder the load.

Make sure people know what is expected of them ahead of time, and find out how people want to contribute.

​	With any organized group, people tend to fall into their natural roles. It’s good to make sure everybody in your group has similar goals, and that they will pull their weight equally. 

Don’t get upset when things don’t come together on the first day. 

People will need time to acclimate, unwind and decompress when they arrive.

Don’t forget to factor in the unpredictable weather. 

Keep in mind that some people just don’t belong at a burn. 

Do yourself a favor, and leave the following people at home:

​	Those who are attached to modern comforts.

​		Outdoor gatherings in nature, with limited access to modern comforts are not for everyone. 

​	Sensitive to noise.

​		Sometimes it gets loud. If you are sensitive to loud music, and people being up at all hours, you may want to reconsider. If you think you can manage,  plan accordingly for those times it may get intense for you.

​	Those who need babysitting. 

​		Don't be a babysitter. 

​			If you find yourself in such a position, not only will they have a horrible time you will resent them for ruining your vacation. This is a huge issue for couples. 

**Couples**

DeJā can be a challenging time for relationships, both with friends and romantic partners. Particularly with partners, it’s important to discuss a few questions in advance before you attend the event. Try to talk about expectations beforehand, as well as during the event. If you can make it through you can most likely make it through anything! Below are some pieces of advice from those who have been there:

**Some questions to consider for your partner:**

​		What should we do if we have an argument?

​		Do we expect to spend a large amount of time with each other every day, or will we be more independent of each other?

​		Do you expect me to sleep in the same tent as you each night?

​		How do you feel about me interacting with someone who is naked?	How would you feel if I wanted to get naked?		

Make sure to schedule dates together and keep them. 

​	Whether you do so to just meet up for tea or coffee, or to wander around together. 

​	Take time to be with each other. 

​	Make your next date as soon as the last one’s over, before the glow fades.

Massage. Feet especially. Increase your tactile time to compensate for the inevitable shortage of routine relationship reassurances that playa life entails.

Treats. Flowers and chocolate, wine and cheese, whatever. The name of this game is “I Went to DeJā. but I Thought \*Only* About You.” Take care of one another. Watch to insure that enough water is going through you both. If you don’t stay hydrated, you’ll be broken up by the end of the event.

Push boundaries? Nyet! Yes DeJā is about self-expression. Does that matter to the heart? No! Even if he/she says ‘it’s ok’ now, it won’t be then, or later.

Be sure to take time with and time away from one another. 

​	Don’t forget that you are individuals. 

​		Exposure to the event has a different impact on everyone. 	

​		One of you may be way into it, while the other might have a hard time adjusting. 

​		One of you might be into sitting around camp and making stuff, while the other wants to don costumes and do performance art

​		Don’t be pushy and expect your partner to do the same things you want to do at every second.

​		Spend all the time together you want, but leave room for yourself and your own interests, too. 

​		Remember that there are new friends for you to meet as well, so each of you should feel encouraged to spend time with other people as well as each other.



**Sex and the Single Burner**

There is a lot of sexual energy whirling about. Anything and everything can and will happen when you gather a bunch of people in this environment. 

Figure out what you want. Love? Sex? Your wildest fantasies? It’s all there for the taking. Make sure the person across from you wants the same thing. If she or he doesn’t, there are others who do. Don’t go breakin’ no hearts.

Be respectful. Just because people are walking around naked does not necessarily mean they wish \*you* were naked in a small enclosed space with them. Learn to take no for an answer, and don’t be afraid to use the “n” word yourself.

Get plenty of rest, monitor your substance intake and hydrate.

Always play safe. 

Make love to the playa, and she will love you back. Become one with the sun, the stars, and the omnipresent dust. 

Don’t be afraid to try new things. If there was ever a space for exploring, this is it! 

Take responsibility for your own pleasure. You can find anything your little heart desires, but you have to ask for it first! If you don’t get what you want, look in the mirror

**I will be right back**

Yeah right . . .

There’s a lot to do and see, and simple tasks take much longer than you think they will. 

You will get side tracked, caught up, distracted 

Cut yourself, and your friends, some slack

DeJā is an experiment in temporary community. You are free to make new rules, and find different ways of relating with people. Learning more about other human beings — and yourself — is a big part of the reason we’re here.

**An Introvert's Guide to DeJā**



 At times, DeJā will feel like it’s been designed for loud, confident and extroverted people. Meeting so many new people can be a bit much if you’re shy or a bit introverted (like 25% of the population), and it can be very easy to feel left out. Or it might just be too much if you’re just not feeling at the top of your game.

**Connecting with other DeJānites**

 Meeting new people is one of the best parts of DeJā, but some people may find this more challenging than others, especially as several DeJāns know each other from previous years and other burner events. Luckily, there’s plenty of ways to feel more integrated.				



​	Volunteering is one of the best ways to meet new people. Working towards a common goal as part of a team lets you meet a great variety of people without having to find ways to break the ice, while giving back to the event. Build and strike are among the best opportunities to do this. Check out our volunteers page for more ideas.

Workshops are a great way to meet likeminded people especially if you’re walking around on your own.

Your own camp is a natural place to meet new friends. Don’t be intimidated if people all seem to know each other – DeJā is one of the most friendly places you can be, so feel free to join in with groups.

Icebreaker questions can be a useful thing to have up your sleeve if you’re feeling quite nervous. 

**After DeJā**

Take some time to reintegrate into default,

​	After experiencing a week of openness,  freedom and self-expression, coming back can be challenging. Side effects might include temptation to throw everything away and run away to the circus, or similar.

<span style ="color:red;">**Do Not **</span>rush into any life-changing decision right away, even if it feels like DeJā has changed you and opened your eyes. 

Leave some time for the dust to settle (no pun intended) before you decide to quit your job, leave your partner, move country or otherwise.

​		If you’ve been doing it for so long, what difference will one month of waiting make?				

​		It might be the right decision in the long run, but chances are that you’re not thinking quite rationally yet.

​	Try your hardest not to be insensitive to the people you’ve left home either. It can be easy for your friends or partner to feel bland and boring compared to what you may experience at the burn.

​		Take the time to reassure them that you still love them and find them interesting, even if they haven’t been to DeJā.

​		Though you might be eager to share this experience with them, respect their wants and needs too, and don’t force-feed them DeJā  stories if they’re not that interested.
