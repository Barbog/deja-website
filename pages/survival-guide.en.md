**This is your Survival Guide** 

packed with important information about what to expect, what you will need and how to prepare to get the most out of the experience. For your safety and best experience, make sure you read it in its entirety BEFORE attending the event.

**READ IT...**

**PICKING UP AFTER YOURSELF**

A vital aspect of participation is to do our part in keeping trash under control. Meaning, ifit isn’t part of the natural environment and it needs to be discarded, then do so in its'appropriate place – a fire pit if it is burnable, compost if it returns to the environment,recyclable where applicable, and refuse if it needs to go out with you.

**BEFORE**

Preparation is key to leaving a better trace. Please keep this in mind when packing!

- <span style="color:red;">Avoid</span> packaging.
- <span style="color:red;">Avoid</span> glass – it can shatter.
- <span style="color:red;">Do not</span> bring: loose glitter, feather boas. Such items are impossible to recover and contaminate the environment.

<span style="color:green;">Do</span> bring:
ü **Bags** for your garbage.
ü **Gloves** – pack work gloves for picking up the sharp bits, and a magnet to help pick up metal.

ü **Your own cup, bowl and eating utensils**: disposable cups, plates and cutlery are one of the biggest sources of trash at festivals. Make sure you always have an easy-to-carry cup with you to use anywhere, anytime. Be responsible for your cup and keep it clean.

ü **SMOKERS: buy or make a portable ashtray** (a mint tin, for instance) to collectyour cigarette butts and ashes. Never, ever drop butts!

• <span style="color:green;">Leave space</span> in your car for taking away your trash.

• If taking the bus or sharing a car, ensure you have a way of taking your garbage with

you, or that you have arranged for its removal.

**DURING**

• **Never let MOOP hit the ground**. Clean as you go. MOOP attracts more MOOP.When you see trash on the ground, pick it up and take it with you.

• The toilets are compost toilets. If it’s not biodegradable, don’t put it down thetoilet. This means no tampons, no trash, no cigarette butts etc.

• Ensure that the compost pile is treated correctly. Only biodegradable food wasteshould be put in the compost pile.

• Separate recycling into glass, plastic, aluminum and cardboard/paper. No trash is to be burned, except for cardboard/paper.

**AFTER**

Remember to leave enough time to help pack up, clean up and ensure that there is noevidence you were ever here.

- Do a sweep of your tent area.
  If you are with a camp, do a line sweep of your camp with your campmates, making sure you cover the whole area, and picking up every single piece of MOOP.
  Nothing is too small. If it wasn’t there before you arrived, it must not be there
  when you leave.

- Sort your trash and recycling for drop-off at allocated sites on your way home. Donot dump your trash anywhere in neighboring communities that is not a designated trashor recycling site.

  • If you are hauling anything that is not inside your vehicle, stop periodically and check to make sure your vehicle’s load is secured and hasn’t loosened in the wind.

City folks are highly advised to dress for the weather! Temperatures will most likely fluctuate between the low 10s and low 30s. Also, be prepared for rain!

SOUND
You may want to sleep while others are partying, so we suggest that you bring earplugs, as the sound travels far on the property. Also, consider camping away from the dance areas or sound systems, especially if you are sensitive to noise or have small children.

23rd OF JUNE
We have chosen the dates of the Baltic Midsummer solstice festivities to coincide with our
event for several reasons – to share this magical time and our local traditions with all of those who attend the event from outside the Baltics and to add the element of a burn to
the national holiday.

On the 23rd we are asking the participants to unplug from the sound systems and go acoustic and tune into the earth.
