"we are not a cult"

Greeters are the first point of contact once paricipants have entered the gates.  Their purpose is to make all arrivals feel welcome and at home.

Upon passing the gates our integrators will interogate and indoctrinate you in the ways of the burn.  Just say yes, please, now and thank you.  Burners need apply.

No minimal level of sobriety required to fulfill these roles.
