Although DeJā is on a relatively safe location, use common sense when exploring, wandering, climbing, etc.

At times DeJā can be potentially challenging, weather wise and emotionally,  come prepared to confront the challenges and be responsible for your own survival.

It is dark on the farm when away from the lit up areas— stay safe: don't be a darkwad and choose to illuminate yourself, your camp area and your artwork at night.

You are responsible for You.

Bring any and all medications that you may need to use.
