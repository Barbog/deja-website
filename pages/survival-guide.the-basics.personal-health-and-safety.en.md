Although DeJā  happens on a relatively safe location: 

- Use common sense when exploring, wandering, climbing, etc.

At times DeJā can be potentially challenging, weather wise and emotionally:

- Come prepared to confront the challenges and be responsible for your own survival.

It is dark on the farm when away from the lit up areas,  stay safe: 

- Don't be a darkwad and choose to illuminate yourself, your camp area and your artwork at night.

  ​

Bring any and all medications that you may need to use.





*You are responsible for You.*
