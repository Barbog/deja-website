We encourage you to turn off your devices and be present.

You are at DeJā to be at DeJā

Because of our location and proximity to the border, we have poor wi-fi/cellular  access on the property and phones are known to roam between both countries networks attempting to find the best signal.  We highly recommend that your phone is set to airplane mode so you don't roam.

Pro Tip:  Turn off your phone and put it away until you leave the property!

We ask that you do not post anything about DeJā to FB or other social media sites during the days while you are at the gathering. Stay present!
