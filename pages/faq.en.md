The visas help us determine how many people will be attending and how they plan to participate. This in turn helps us with the logistics of the infrastructure as well as providing a census.

<span style="color:#77011e;"> <u>"I am busy and don't have time to read all of this, can i just send someone a message and let them no I am coming"</u></span>

No sorry, you cannot.  If you do not have time to read the information on this site to get into essentially a free event, then you most likely don't have the time to prepare and organize yourself to come to it and participate accordingly.  



<span style="color:#77011e;"> <u>"I heard that [Burning Man](http://burningman.org/) is happening in Latvia"</u></span>

Unfortunately you heard wrong info. What has come to Latvia is a gathering inspired by the ethos of [Burning Man.](http://burningman.org/) A regional event known to the locals as Degošie Jāņi, or DeJā for short, which celebrates  and highlighs the local national holiday and is infused with the flavor of the event that happens out in Nevada.  We are an unofficial regional event and will continue to be so as this is the wish of the local community.
