Anyone under the age of 18 needs to be accompanied by a guardian in order to enter as DeJā is an adult-oriented event.  DeJā does not dictate what is appropriate for your kids, nor assumes responsibility for the safety of your children – as their parents, you do.

​	**Pets** 

​		At this time we are open to having pets on site during the gathering. Keep in mind that there may be other animals on the farm. You are responsible for your pets' well being and cleaning up after them. 

​		  If not having your pet with you is going to keep you from the event, then by all means, bring them with you, but please, pick up after them when they shit – we don't want to step on a hot pile of steaming crap while running around barefoot!

​	**23rd of June** - Jāņi, Līgo

​		We have chosen the dates of the local midsummer solstice festivities to coincide with our event for several reasons:

​			To share this magical time and our local traditions with all of those who attend the event from outside the Baltic States.

​			To add the element of a burn to this national holiday.

​			To share the burn experience with the local community as well as those burn curious who have yet to experience our culture

​			To share the local midsummer traditions with those who travel from abroad to celebrate with us. 

​		On the 23rd we are asking the participants to unplug from the sound systems and tune into the earth and consider playing acoustic sets instead.

​	**Lost Property/Lost and Found**

​		If you find something that appears to belong to someone else, ask around in the immediate vicinity. If no one claims it, take it to the Info Center.  Similarly, if you have lost something, then go ask at the Info Center.

​	**Latvian Law** 

​		All participants are reminded that despite going to the farm to celebrate DeJā, you are bound by the local and national laws of Latvia. Please check the local laws before you leave home.

​		If you are planning on driving while in Latvia, you should check that your insurance and license are valid in Latvia. You can get advice on this from the Latvian embassy in your country. 

​		During this time of year, there are many checkpoints on the roads. Please, do not drive while intoxicated! 

​		DeJā does not condone illegal drug use and strongly advises against individuals taking risks with their health out in the open country. 

​		Please bear in mind the limited medical support on site before you consider placing yourself at risk.
