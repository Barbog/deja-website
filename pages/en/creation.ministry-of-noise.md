This ministry is made up of all the DJ's, VJ's, and tech people that bring the noise to farm. They facilitate the quality and quantity of sound.

If you DJ, you are invited to collaborate with others to create your own theme in a dome or however you chose to set up your dance area. 



There are no shifts for this ministry. If you wish to perform and  collaborate  please use our Noise channel in Slack to make yourself known and be in contact with the noise lead who will be able to answer your questions.
