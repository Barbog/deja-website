You may want to sleep while others are partying,

- Bring earplugs, as the sound travels far on the property.

There is a “quiet camping” area on the property,

- You may consider camping away from the dance areas or sound systems, especially if you are sensitive to noise or have small children.

This year, DeJā will provide one sound system for the event, smaller than the previous 4 years.  More camps have been showing up with their own sound systems, so to prevent sound bleeding, sound camp placement will be necessary so as to minimize the sound cross over. 

- <span style="color:#fdb913;">You are encouraged</span> to bring your own system or collaborate and create a sound camp of your own with other participants.
  - If doing so, Be thoughtful of your neighbors, contact our Minister of Noise, so we can place your camp accordingly. 

We have a casual curfew, meaning that between the hours of 6:00am and 9:00am music will be turned down/off to allow people to sleep if they so choose to.
