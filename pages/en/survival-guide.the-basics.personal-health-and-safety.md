Although DeJā happens on a relatively safe location:

- <span style="color:#fdb913;">Use common sense</span> when exploring, wandering, climbing, etc.

At times DeJā can be potentially challenging, weather wise and emotionally:

- Come prepared to confront the challenges and be responsible for your own survival.

It is dark on the farm when away from the lit up areas,  stay safe:

- Don't be a darkwad and choose to illuminate yourself, your camp area and your artwork at night.



Bring any and all medications that you may need to use.



<span style="color:#fdb913;">You are responsible for You.</span>
