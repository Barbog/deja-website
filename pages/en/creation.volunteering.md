Getting involved is an integral part of the event and a great way to meet others.  You are welcome to participate in any way that you see will improve our gathering.  You are also welcome to volunteer at one of the various posts throughout the event.

If you are still unsure as to what you would like to do, how you could get involved or need some inspiration – read on!



We have organized the event into eleven “ministries” that distribute various responsibilities that come with creating an event as such. This cabinet is made up of volunteers  who wish to see DeJā happen again.

We hope that by sharing our infrastructure you will gain a better understanding as to where your talents can be beneficial!
