You are at DeJā to be at DeJā

Because of the location and proximity to the border, there is poor wi-fi/cellular  access on the property and phones will roam between different providers, attempting to find the best signal.

- set to airplane mode so you don't roam.



<span style="color:#fdb913;">Pro Tip:</span>  Turn off your phone and put it away until you leave the property!



<span style="color:#77011e;">do not post</span>  anything about DeJā to FB or other social media sites during the days while you are at the gathering.



<span style="color:#fdb913;">Stay present!</span>
