**we are not a cult**

**Greeters** are the first point of contact once paricipants have entered the gates.  Their purpose is to make all arrivals feel welcome and at home.  

Upon passing the gates our integrators may interogate and indoctrinate you, by whichever mean consensually suits your needs,  in the ways of the burn.  Just say:  yes, please, now and thank you.  

No minimal level of sobriety required to fulfill these roles, but experienced burners preferred for leading and volunteering for this team.
