<span style="color:#77011e;">23rd of June - Jāņi, Līgo</span>

The dates chosen for DeJā coincide with the midsummer solstice  for several reasons:

- To add the element of a burn to this national holiday.
- To share the burn experience locally.
- To share this magical time and the local traditions with those who travel from outside the Baltic States to celebrate the midsummer here.



On the 23rd the participants are urged to unplug from the sound systems and tune into the earth.

- Consider playing instruments and acoustic sets instead.
- If you choose to DJ, be mindful of the tunes you choose.
