Many opportunities for photography will arise at DeJā. <span style="color:#006a44;">**Please**</span>  ask permission before doing so.  If the moment you want to capture will be lost,  immediately ask after taking it.

Things to keep in mind when taking a photo.

- Find out if they will be ok with you sharing the images online or elsewhere.
- Remember, no one has a right to photograph or film you if you do not wish to be photographed.
- <span style="color:#77011e;">**No photos</span> should be taken or published for commercial use!**
- <span style="color:#fdb913;"><u>**Suggestion**</u></span>:  You are at DeJā to be at DeJā, not to spend your time on (insert your preferred  social media of choice here).
- <span style="color:#006a44;">**Please**</span> abstain from posting on social media during the days of the gathering.
