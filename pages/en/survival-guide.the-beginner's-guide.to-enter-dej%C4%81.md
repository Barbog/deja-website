<span style="color:#77011e;"><u>**Why do I need to be on the guest list if this is a burn?**</u></span>

Because your entry application will get your name on the guest list. If you are not on the list, you will be denied entry.

DeJƒÅ is a private gathering celebrated on private property, open to those who learn about the event and make their way to the property.

The entries help us determine how many people will be attending and how they plan to participate. This in turn helps us with the logistics of the infrastructure as well as providing a census. The applications also help us keep balance between those who understand our culture and those who may be new to it.

<span style="color:#77011e;"><u>**Why can't I open the entry application tab?**</u></span>

If you wish to participate, start by reading:

- Burn Etiquette
- Survival Guide

After you have done so, you will be be able to do so.

**Be on time and fill yours out before May 31st.**
