<span style="color:limegreen;"><u>After DeJā</u></span>

After experiencing a week of openness,  freedom and self-expression, coming back can be challenging.  Side effects might include temptation to throw everything away and run away to the circus, or something similar.  Take some time to reintegrate into default,

- <span style ="color:#77011e;">;**Do Not**</span> rush into any life-changing decision right away.
  - Even if it feels like DeJā has changed you and opened your eyes.
- Leave some time for the dust to settle (no pun intended) before you decide to quit your job, leave your partner, move country or otherwise.
  - It might be the right decision in the long run, but chances are that you’re not thinking quite rationally yet.
- Try your hardest not to be insensitive to the people you’ve left home either.
  - It can be easy for your friends or partner to feel bland and boring compared to what you may experience at the burn.
  - Take the time to reassure them that you still love them and find them interesting, even if they haven’t been to DeJā.
  - Though you might be eager to share this experience with them, respect their wants and needs too,
    - <span style="color:#77011e;">Do Not</span> force-feed them DeJā stories if they’re not that interested.

<span style="color:limegreen;">**<u>Stay Connected</u>**</span>

It is not uncommon to experience feelings of wanting to reunite and return.

<span style="color:#fdb913;">TIP</span>:  carry a notebook and something to write with so you can collect contact information of your new friends.
