It is up to each of us to care for the longevity of our event by remaining aware of our environment and not leaving any trash anywhere on the property.

**M.O.O.P.** is <span style="color:#77011e;">**Matter Out Of Place.**</span>

If it doesn't look like it belongs on the ground, pick it up and put it with your garbage.

- <span style="color:#77011e;">**Never**</span> ever let trash hit the ground.
- <span style="color:#006a44;">**Pick up after yourself.**</span>
- If it is your cigarette butt, beer can or decoration, it goes with you when you leave. **No excuses**.
- Take everything you bring to the event back home with you: pack it in, pack it out – every last tiny scrap.
- If you happen to see someone littering, kindly educate them.  No trash bins will be provided.



Where ever we gather, whenever possible, we leave only footprints and a better trace.
