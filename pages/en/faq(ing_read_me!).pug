<span style="color:#77011e;"><u>"What is a burn?"</u></span>

A burn is an autonomous, non-commercial gathering, co-created by the attending participants who are guided by the principles of [Burning Man](http://burningman.org/).



<span style="color:#77011e;"><u>"Why do i need a visa?"</u></span>

DeJā is an interactive and participatory event, by filling out your visa application you enter the rabbit hole. Doing so is your first step in getting involved and shows your interest in participating.   Once you have submitted your visa, you will receive a notification with details you will need to read and your name will be added to the guest list.



<span style="color:#77011e;"><u>"Why do I need to be on the guest list if this is a burn?"</u></span>

DeJā is a private gathering celebrated on private property, open to those who learn about the event and make their way to the property.

The visas help to determine how many people will be attending and how they plan to participate. This in turn helps with the logistics of the infrastructure as well as providing a census.



<span style="color:#77011e;"><u> "How can I participate in DeJā?"</u></span>

- First, register to this site if you haven't done so already.  Start by going to the log in button on the top left of the site and follow the link.

- Second, check your email for the password.  You will be able to change it after you have logged in.

- Third, log in and read sections: Burn Etiquette and Survival Guide and answer the questions at the end of the sections.

- Fourth, fill out the visa application, which will only become available after reading both sections and answering the test questions.

- Fifth, get involved, create a project, a workshop, volunteer, donate, check the slack channel which you will be invited to join and paricipate in the conversations that interest you.



<span style="color:#77011e;"><u>Why can't I open the visa application tab?</u></span>

The Visa will only be available after you have read the:

- Burn Etiquette

- Survival Guide

- And have answered the questions at the end of each section.



<span style="color:#77011e;"><u>"I have an idea for a(n) (fire sculpture, art installation, workshop, etc) , is it ok for me to do this?"</u></span>

DeJā is a canvass for you to come and express yourself.  If you have an idea that you wish to materialize, DeJā is most likely the place to do it at.  Please refer to the "fire rules" and the "making your art green" sections inside of the website, once you have registered and logged in.



<span style="color:#77011e;"><u>"This is my first burn and I have no idea as to what to do for the event, how can i help?"</u></span>

If you are unsure as to what to do, take a look at the "creation" section after you have registered and logged in, this will give you an idea as to how the infrastructure of the event is organized and where you can volunteer.  Once you arrive at DeJā you will be able to sign up for one or more of the various shifts at the posts where volunteers will be needed.  If this is your first burn, integrate and take it easy, get familiar with the grounds, and consider volunteering 1 or 2 shifts.



<span style="color:#77011e;"><u>"If you need help let me know"</u></span>

Yes, help is needed. However, keep in mind that DeJā is created by its participants, what you create for the event, what you wish to share and bring to the gathering, whether it is time, resources, art, energy or some of each, this is how you help the event, this is your contribution to the community.  DeJā is a do-acracy, meaning if you see that something needs to be done, go ahead and do it.  If you think of something that will improve the gathering, take it upon yourself to do it.



<span style="color:#77011e;"> <u>"I am busy and don't have time to read all of this, can i just send someone a message and let them no I am coming"</u></span>

No sorry, you cannot. This event operates under the premise that all animals are created equal, if the registration process is changed for you, then it has to be changed for everyone else.    If you do not have time to read the information on this site to get into essentially a free event, then you most likely don't have the time to prepare and organize yourself to come to it and participate accordingly.



<span style="color:#77011e;"> <u>"I heard that [Burning Man](http://burningman.org/) is happening in Latvia"</u></span>

Unfortunately you heard wrong info. What has come to Latvia is a gathering inspired by the ethos of [Burning Man.](http://burningman.org/) A regional event known to the locals as Degošie Jāņi, or DeJā for short, which celebrates  and highlighs the local national holiday and is infused with the flavor of the event that happens out in Nevada.  We are an unofficial regional event and will continue to be so as this is the wish of the local community.
