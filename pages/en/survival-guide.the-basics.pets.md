Having pets on site during the gathering is allowed.  However:

- Keep in mind that there may be other animals on the farm.
- You are responsible for your pets' well being and cleaning up after them.
- Keep in mind that there may be participants which could be afraid of your pet ostrich or your comfort peacock.

If not having your pet with you is going to keep you from the event, then by all means, bring them with you, but please, pick up after them when they shit â€“ we don't want to step on a hot pile of steaming crap while running around barefoot!
