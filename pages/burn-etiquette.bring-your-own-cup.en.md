# Bring Your Own Cup

DeJā is a BYOC-event, meaning that you are supposed to bring and take responsibility for your own cup, bowl and cutlery.

​There will be participants offering food or drinks and if all of them bring disposable utensils it adds unnecessary strain on both our event and our planet. BYOC solves this problem.
