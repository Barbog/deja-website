<u>**Checking in**</u>

When you arrive at DeJā,  you will first be required to check in at the gate.  All co-creators will be required to show their approved visa along with their ID to be able to check in. You can use a digital copy instead of printing it out. 

​The greeters team will be there to help you integrate.

​Make yourself familiar with the area and neighbors before you start setting up.



<u>**Early arrivals**</u>

This year the gathering will begin on Wednesday the 21st of June, 2017 so as to include the equinox.

Those who volunteer for build are welcome on the property starting Saturday June 17th.

We encourage you to come as early as you can manage if you you are setting up an installation or theme camp.



<u>**Parking**</u>

All cars and vehicles please have: **driver's name,  tent location/color phone number/contact method/ fixed to one of your windows ** so someone can contact you if need be.

- You are allowed to drive to your camp and drop off your gear and then come back and park in the lot. 
- There is a designated area for RV's and campers.
- Please park in the designated lot on property, if additional parking is necessary, the gate crew or the integration crew will help you figure out where to park.
- Cars that are not essential part of the art  (mutant vehicles/art cars) or camp should be parked in the designated parking area.



<u>**Camping**</u>

- There are 3 designated areas for camping:
  - The quiet zone, located on the far side of the western tree line.
  - The village.
  - The RV and camper site. 
- Both the quiet zone and the village may require that you cut down the grass before you set up.



<u>**Leaving**</u>

​You are welcome to leave DeJā during the week. However, we suggest that you don't.  When you leave, you pop your bubble, by exposing yourself to the default world.

- When people leave, it usually takes them some time to get back into the vibe when they return to DeJā, which also affects others.

<span style="color:gold;">TIP:</span> Put your full focus on living in our village for the duration of the event. You have 51 weeks a year to live in the default world.

- We encourage you to leave on Sunday, after MOOP lines are done. 

  -  IF we didn't already say it, take your garbage with you and dispose of it properly/
