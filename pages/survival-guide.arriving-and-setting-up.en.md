The RV and camper siteBoth the quiet zone and the village will require that you cut down the grass before you set up.



**Leaving**

You are allowed to leave DeJā during the week. However, we suggest that you don't.

​When you leave, you pop your bubble, by exposing yourself to the default world.

​When people leave, it usually takes them time to get back in to the zone when they return to DeJā, which also affects others.

​Put your full focus on living in our imaginary land for the whole week. You have 51 weeks a year to live in the default world.

We encourage you to leave on Sunday, after cleanup. We encourage you to take your garbage with you, and if you can fit one extra bag (or more) please take it with you and dispose of it properly.
