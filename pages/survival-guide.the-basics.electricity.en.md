There is limited electricity which can be used for the event at the farm. However, this is being used for the kitchen and for the main sound stage. 

We do not wish to create an expense for the farm with our use of their power, so it is highly suggested that you supply your own power if you will be needing some for your camp, installation or sound stage.

- You are <span style="color:#fdb913;"> encouraged to lead and organize</span>  the rental of a generator for your needs. 
  - If you do, please find a way to muffle the noise, so the sounds of nature are not drowned out by the noise these create.



<span style="color:#fdb913;">Pro Tip:</span>  if you can generate power in a cleaner or greener way for your purposes, we highly encourage you to go this route.
