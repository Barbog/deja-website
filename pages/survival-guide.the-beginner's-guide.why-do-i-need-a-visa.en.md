<u>Why do I need to be on the guest list if this is a burn?</u>

DeJā is a private gathering celebrated on private property, open to those who learn about the event and make their way to the property.  

The visas help us determine how many people will be attending and how they plan to participate. This in turn helps us with the logistics of the infrastructure as well as providing a census. The applications also help us keep balance between those who understand our culture and those who may be new to it.

<u>Why can't I open the visa application tab?</u>

- Burn Etiquette
- Survival Guide

After you have done so, you will be be able to do so.
