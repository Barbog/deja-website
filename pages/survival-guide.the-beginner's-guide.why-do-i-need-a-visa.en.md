​DeJā is a private gathering celebrated on private property, open to those who learn about the event and make their way to the property.  The visas help us determine how many people will be attending and how they plan to participate. This in turn helps us with the logistics of the infrastructure as well as providing a census. The applications also help us keep balance between those who understand our culture and those who may be new to it.

​So if you wish to particiapate, start with the process of filling out the visa.  Your visa application gets your name on the entry list.

​Not on the list? No entry. No exceptions!

​Be on time and fill yours out!
