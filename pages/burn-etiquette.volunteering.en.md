# **Volunteer**

There are many opportunities to volunteer at DeJā,  either at the event or year-round, either way you will be playing an invaluable role in this ongoing experiment.



Volunteering is a form of participation, gifting and civic responsibility.  No matter your skills or interests, there are many ways to contribute your time, energy, and resources.  

If you wish to learn how to volunteer year round, read more here and learn what you can do to get involved with the infrastructure crew.
