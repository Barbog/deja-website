There are many opportunities to volunteer at DeJā,  either at the event or year-round, either way you will be playing an invaluable role in this ongoing experiment.



Volunteering is a form of participation, gifting and civic responsibility.  No matter your skills or interests, there are many ways to contribute your time, energy, and resources.
