# Photo & Video Policy

Many opportunities for photography will arise at DeJā, please ask the individual(s):

- Permission for taking their photo(s)

- If they are ok with you sharing the images online or elsewhere.

- No one has a right to photograph or film you if you do not wish to be photographed.

- <span style="color:red">**No photos should be taken and published for commercial use!**</span>

- <span style="color:gold;">SUGGESTION</span>:  You are at DeJā to be at DeJā, not to spend your time on (insert your social media of choice here). Please abstain from posting on social media during the days of the gathering.
