At DeJā, a kitchen for communal use has been organized to minimize the weight load of those traveling from afar.  This has been done with the intention that the participants have more time to dedicate to their art installations and projects.  

If you wish to cook, you are welcome to use the facilities, and you are encouraged to help keep the area clean.  Please abide by the posted rules you will see in the kitchen area. If there is something you prefer to use when cooking and rather not live without,  bring it with you.


 <span style="color:#fdb913;">NOTICE: </span>  It is of the most importance that you use the hand washing station before entering the kitchen area to prevent the entire camp from catching a stomach virus.

Remember:

- Please use the handwashing station before entering the kitchen.
- Please ensure that anyone working with you in the kitchen does the same. Remind anyone who enters the preparing area to wash their hands.
- Rotate and change the wet station as needed while you are using the kitchen.
- Clean up whatever you dirty. You are responsible for cleaning up after yourself and for washing your personal utensils and dishes.
- If you see that something that needs to be done, take it upon yourself to see that it gets done.



One other thing:

There will be an option to purchase into the meal plan pre-event.  If you chose this, a portion of your  meal dues will be used to feed the volunteers at the different posts throughout the event. You can learn more about this on our Slack channel.
