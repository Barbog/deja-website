These come in the form of time, energy, resources or funds. Everyone involved in the gathering contributes in the best way they can, thus benefiting the entire community. Even though we don’t condone monetary transactions during the event, expenses associated with producing the event do arise. We ask you to consider contributing in a way in which you feel most comfortable doing so, preferably before the visa submission deadline, if possible.   If you decide to contribute financially, you are well within your rights to let us know how you wish for your monetary contribution to be used.

​If we have enough donations to gift grants, then these grants will be distributed to those participants who submit their request for a grant in writing. (enter email as to where to send request) In it you should include the cost of creating your piece.  The amount of the grant will be based on the donations we receive this year and how many grant requests we receive.
