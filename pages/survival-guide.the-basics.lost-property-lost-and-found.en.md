If you find something that appears to belong to someone else, ask around in the immediate vicinity. If no one claims it, take it to the Info Center.  



Similarly, if you have lost something, check the lost and found at the Info Center.





TIP: Tag your belongings to make them easier to be found and returned if lost.
