The only thing predictable about the weather during the midsummer is that it is unpredictable, with likely chances of rain.  The event takes place on a farm, which is located deep in the country. City folks are highly advised to dress for the weather!

- Temperatures will most likely fluctuate between the low 10s during the nights and high 30s during the day.
- **Be prepared for rain!**  Ponchos and rain boots are highly recommended.
- Warm clothing is suggested, especially during the nights.
- Consider layering your clothes.
- Bring eco-friendly bug repellant for mosquitoes and ticks.
- Don't forget your sunglasses and sunscreen.
