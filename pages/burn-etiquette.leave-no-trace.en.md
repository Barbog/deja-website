It is up to each of us to care for the longevity of our event by remaining aware of our environment and not leaving any trash anywhere on the property.	 

**MOOP** is Matter out of Place.

If it doesn't look like it belongs on the ground, pick it up and put it with your garbage.

- Never ever let trash hit the ground. 
- Pick up after yourself.
- If it is your cigarette butt, beer can or decoration, it goes with you when you leave. No excuses.
- Please take everything you bring to the event back home with you: pack it in, pack it out – every last tiny scrap.
- If you happen to see someone littering, kindly educate them.  No trash bins will be provided.



Where ever we gather, whenever possible, we leave only footprints and a better trace.
