# Leave No Trace

It is up to each of us to care for the longevity of our event by remaining aware of our environment, and not leaving any trash anywhere on the property.	 Pick up after yourself.

**MOOP** is Matter out of Place.

​- If it doesn't look like it belongs on the ground, pick it up and put it with your garbage.

- Never ever let trash hit the ground.

- If it is your cigarette butt, beer can or decoration, it goes with you when you leave. No excuses.

- Please take everything you bring to the event back home with you: pack it in, pack it out – every last tiny scrap.

- If you happen to see someone littering, kindly educate them.

- No trash bins will be provided.
