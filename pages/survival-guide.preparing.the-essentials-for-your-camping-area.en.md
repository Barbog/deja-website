<span style="color:lime;"><u>For your camping area:</u></span>

- Bags - good for carrying with you to collect any random MOOP  as you wander around the property  so that you can do your part in Leaving a Better Trace.
- **Pocket ashtray**, if you are a smoker.
- <span style="color:yellow;>**Torch** </span>- LED head-torches are great, as the batteries last well and your hands are left free.
- **Bug repellent.**
- Be aware you may encounter tics
- **Sunscreen**.
- Any **toiletries and hygiene items** you might need.

- **Toilet paper** for gifting to the public toilets as well as for own use.
- A basic **first aid kit** and any medicines you might need.

- <span style="color:orange;>**Earplugs**</span> if you're a light sleeper.

<span style="color:lime;><u>**Things to gift:**</u></span>

- extra stuff from this list will do much better than trinkets as everybody forgets something.
- <span style="color:seagreen;>**All materials and tools**</span> you require for your projects!

- **Rain boots and warm socks** to keep your feet dry,
- **Sunglasses**
- <span style="color:dodgerblue;>**Water-resisting clothes**</span>
- **Poncho** (bling it out)


<span style="color:lime;>**The Essentials - Very Good to Have**</span>

- <span style="color:yellow;>**Intoxicating aids**</span>
- Because gifting is an essential part of DeJā, it is recommend to bring more then you need, to gift  to others during the event.
  NOTE: Beer is the traditional drink of choice during the Midsummer celebration.


<span style="color:lime;>**Exotic clothing**</span>
- Dress up items, costumes, togas,  - whatever you feel comfortable wearing or not wearing at all.
- Furry clothing, onesies.
- Be a superhero, a unicorn, a vicar in a tutu, or a nun.  Be a fairy, an elf, a hobbit, a racoon. . .
  **Remember: no glitter and feathers!!!**
- **<span style="color:fuchsia;>LED or other lighting for clothes**  
	-There are no lights once it is dark, so the easiest way to be recognised is by wearing something that emits light. 
	Buy some form of LED lights operating on battery, and attach them to your clothes or headgear.  The more colourful the better.
