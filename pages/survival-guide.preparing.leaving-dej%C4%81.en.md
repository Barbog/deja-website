<span style="color:lime;"><u>**Leaving DeJā**</u></span>

<span style="color:tomato;">**Don’t Rush**</span>  do not stress to hurry home.

Long-term exposure to the burn may fatigue your body and impair decision-making. 

When under pressure, we are all likely to make rushed decisions, miss details and leave things behind.  If you have to catch a plane, make sure to start packing up even earlier than you think you may have to, so you aren’t tempted to leave before fully clearing your site.



<span style="color:lime;"><u>**Packing and Departure**</u></span>

- <span style="color:greenyellow;">**Do**</span> a MOOP sweep of your tent area.
- As you’re packing your camp, have campmates walk repeatedly around your site picking up anything and everything that’s not part of the farm.

<span style="color:gold;">**TIP**</span>: Doing this periodically, through the week, will make it easier.

<span style="color:greenyellow;">**Do**</span> a line sweep of your camp with your campmates, making sure you cover the whole area,  picking up every single piece of MOOP.
- Nothing is too small.  If it wasn’t there before you arrived, it must not be there when you leave.
- If half of your campmates will have left before you, the folks left behind are going to have a lot more work to do.
- <span style="color:orange;">**Remember**</span> to leave enough time to help pack up, clean up and ensure that there is no evidence you were ever there.
- <span style="color:greenyellow;">**Sort**</span>your trash and recycling for drop-off at allocated sites on your way home.
- <span style="color:tomato;">**Do not**</span> dump your trash anywhere in neighboring communities that is not a designated trash or recycling site.
- <span style="color:greenyellow;">**Take** your trash with you! And if you have space, please take an orphan bag if you see one at the gate on your way out.
- If you are hauling anything that is not inside your vehicle, stop periodically and check to make sure your vehicle’s load is secured and hasn’t loosened in the wind.
