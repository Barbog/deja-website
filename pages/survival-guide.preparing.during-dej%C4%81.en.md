<span style="color:dodgerblue;">**As you are preparin to leave**

**Do a MOOP sweep of your tent area.As you’re packing your camp, have campmates walk repeatedly around your site picking up anything and everything that’s not part of the farm.TIP : Doing this periodically, through the week, will make it easier.If you are with a village, do a line sweep of your camp with your campmates, making sure you cover the whole area, and picking up every single piece of MOOP. Nothing is too small. If it wasn’t there before you arrived, it must not be there when you leave.If half of your campmates will have left before you, the folks left behind are going to have a lot more work to do. Remember to leave enough time to help pack up, clean up and ensure that there is no evidence you were ever here.Sort your trash and recycling for drop-off at allocated sites on your way home. Do not dump your trash anywhere in neighboring communities that is not a designated trash or recycling site.Take your trash with you! And if you have space, please take an orphan bag if you see one at the gate on your way out. If you are hauling anything that is not inside your vehicle, stop periodically and check to make sure your vehicle’s load is secured and hasn’t loosened in the wind.Don’t Rush Packing and DepartureDon’t stress to hurry home. Long-term exposure to the burn may fatigue your body and impair decision-making. When under pressure, we are all likely to make rushed decisions, miss details and leave things behind. If someone has to catch a plane, make sure to start packing up even earlier than you think you have to, so that you aren’t tempted to leave before fully clearing your site.**
