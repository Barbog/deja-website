<span style="color:lime;"><u>**During DeJā**</u></span>

**<span style="color:dodgerblue;">Be Aware </span>** of very small items.  No Trace really does mean no trace.

- Clean as you go.  MOOP attracts more MOOP.
- When you see trash on the ground, pick it up and take it with you.
- <span style="color:dodgerblue;">Be conscious</span> of smaller trash particles that may be dismissed as too small for trash including:  matches, cigarette butts, feathers, zip ties.
- After you pick up your trash to carry home, do a last-minute check of your site for cigarette butts, gum wrappers, etc. 

<span style="color:greenyellow;">Ensure </span>that the compost pile is treated correctly.  Only biodegradable food waste should be put in the compost pile.

- Food waste such as nut shells, citrus peels and eggshells are also trash. Dispose of these in the compost.

<span style="color:greenyellow green;">**Separate**</span> recycling into glass, plastic, aluminum and cardboard/paper.

<span style="color:tomato;">**No**</span> trash is to be burned, except for cardboard/paper.

<span style="color:lime;"><u>**toilets**</u></span>

The toilets are compost toilets.  If it’s not biodegradable, don’t put it in the hole.  This means no tampons, no trash, no cigarette butts etc.

<span style="color:tomato;">**Do Not**</span><span style="color:lime;"> **Use the Farm as Your Toilet**</span>
This is unacceptable, unsanitary, and just plain gross the morning after if several hundred people are using the farm in this way.  If you bring a pet with you, make certain to remove their waste just as you would your own.

<span style="color:greenyellow;">**Minimize Fire Impacts**</span>  Keep in mind that most non-natural materials (rugs, polyester, plastic, treated wood) are toxic when burned.

<span style="color:greenyellow>;">**Respect Wildlife**</span>  If you happen to come across any wild life that wanders into camp, please Do not harass it.
