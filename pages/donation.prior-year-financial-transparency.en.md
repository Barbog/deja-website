# Donations for 2015/Financial Report & Expenses

An event such as this does incur expenses.  In 2015, we received 2 generous donations from 2 anonymous benefactors. One donation, was specifically donated, to be used towards sound. The other was used for infrastructure (toilets, transport, effigy, kitchen, hand sanitizer and other random expenses)

Their total contribution to the event was 1750EUR.  We believe in full transparency, so below we have attached the budget in PDF format showing how we spent the donations last summer. Please take a momentto look it over now.

In 2016 we received xxxxEUR from xx participants who had been to DeJƒÅ before and could not make it as well as from some who were attending for the first time.

If we were to divide the 1750 EUR amongst the 212 participants, the quotient would come to 8.25EUR in donations per attendee for the 5-day gathering.  Since we do not wish to charge for this event, we are asking you to keep this in mind and to please consider making a donation/gift for our 2016 gathering.
