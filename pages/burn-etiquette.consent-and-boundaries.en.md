<span style="color:#77011e;"><u>**CONSENT, CONSIDERATION AND BOUNDARIES**</u></span>

DeJā is a pro-consent event.  It is an extremely free and open-minded environment . . . However, it is important to be respectful of other people’s boundaries.

Each of us wants to help prevent sexual harassment and assault while ensuring that sex positive free expression thrives.

- Know and express your own sexual boundaries.
- <span style="color:#006a44;"><u>Ask for consent, first!</u></span>
  - Make sure that all sides are mutually in agreement prior to physical encounters (hugging, groping, spanking, sex)
- Be respectful.
   <span style="color:#fdb913;">**<u>Consent must be clearly granted</u>**</span> from an individual who is clearly in control of their faculties enough to grant it.
- If someone is not in control of their faculties,  <span style="color:#77011e;">they cannot grant you consent.
- If someone’s behaviour is really disrespectful or downright dangerous and asking them to stop is not enough, make yourself heard or report them at the Info Center.



Everyone has different boundaries. . . be considerate and ask.  There is no harm in asking.
