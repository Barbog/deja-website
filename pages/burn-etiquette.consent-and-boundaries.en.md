# Consent and Boundaries (bold and banner)

**CONSENT, CONSIDERATION AND BOUNDARIES**

Always ask for consent, always be considerate, and always respect! Communication is the best lubricant – use it!

Although DeJā is an extremely free and open-minded environment, it is important to be respectful of other people’s boundaries! We want to help prevent sexual harassment and assault while ensuring that sex positive free expression thrives. It is imperative to know and express our own sexual boundaries and to respect our partners’ boundaries.

If you feel someone’s behavior is really disrespectful or you feel threatened, ask them to stop. If they continue, report them at the Info Center.

DeJā is a pro-consent event. Although it is an extremely free and open-minded environment, it is important to be respectful of other people’s boundaries!

Consent must be clearly granted from an individual who is clearly in control of their faculties enough to grant it.

​	If someone is not in control of their faculties, they cannot grant you consent.

It is imperative to know and express our own boundaries, sexual or otherwise, and to respect the boundaries of others.

Make sure that all sides are mutually consensual prior to physical encounters (ie hugging, groping, spanking, sexual encounters)

​	For example, while chatting to a nude person you might be fine, but a hug from them might make you feel uncomfortable.

​		Say so – otherwise they may never guess!

​	Remember that not everyone might appreciate a bear hug from you either.

​		Everyone has different boundaries. There’re plenty of people who’d love a hug from you, so don’t force them on people who might not enjoy it – naked or not. There’s no harm in asking.

We want to help prevent sexual harassment and assault while ensuring that sex positive free expression thrives.

If you feel someone’s behavior is really disrespectful or you feel threatened, ask them to stop.  

If someone’s behaviour is really disrespectful or downright dangerous and asking them to stop is not enough, make yourself heard or report them at the Info Center.
