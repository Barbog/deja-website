<u>**CONSENT, CONSIDERATION AND BOUNDARIES**</u>

DeJā is a pro-consent event.  It is an extremely free and open-minded environment . . . However, it is important to be respectful of other people’s boundaries.

Each of us wants to help prevent sexual harassment and assault while ensuring that sex positive free expression thrives.

- Know and express your own sexual boundaries.
- Ask for consent, first!
  - Make sure that all sides are mutually in agreement prior to physical encounters (hugging, groping, spanking, sex)
- Be respectful.
	**<u>Consent must be clearly granted</u>** from an individual who is clearly in control of their faculties enough to grant it.
  - If someone is not in control of their faculties,  <u>they cannot grant you consent</u>.
- If someone’s behaviour is really disrespectful or downright dangerous and asking them to stop is not enough, make yourself heard or report them at the Info Center.



Everyone has different boundaries. 

	There’s no harm in asking.
