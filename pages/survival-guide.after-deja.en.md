Take some time to reintegrate into default,

After experiencing a week of openness,  freedom and self-expression, coming back can be challenging. Side effects might include temptation to throw everything away and run away to the circus, or similar.

<span style ="color:red;">**Do Not**</span> rush into any life-changing decision right away, even if it feels like DeJā has changed you and opened your eyes.

Leave some time for the dust to settle (no pun intended) before you decide to quit your job, leave your partner, move country or otherwise.

If you’ve been doing it for so long, what difference will one month of waiting make?

​It might be the right decision in the long run, but chances are that you’re not thinking quite rationally yet.

​Try your hardest not to be insensitive to the people you’ve left home either. It can be easy for your friends or partner to feel bland and boring compared to what you may experience at the burn.

​Take the time to reassure them that you still love them and find them interesting, even if they haven’t been to DeJā.

​Though you might be eager to share this experience with them, respect their wants and needs too, and don’t force-feed them DeJā stories if they’re not that interested.
