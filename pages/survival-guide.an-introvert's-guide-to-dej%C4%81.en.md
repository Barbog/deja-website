At times, DeJā will feel like it’s been designed for loud, confident and extroverted people. Meeting so many new people can be a bit much if you’re shy or a bit introverted (like 25% of the population), and it can be very easy to feel left out. Or it might just be too much if you’re just not feeling at the top of your game.

- Remember, there’s no right or wrong way to experience DeJā. 
  - Don’t feel comfortable jumping naked over the fire? Don’t do it. 
- Maybe DeJā for you will be more about admiring the stars and having meaningful conversations with friends than it will be about partying - and that’s perfectly okay. 
- Try spending a day reflecting on your experiences, taking time for you. 
- Don’t feel like you have to go full throtle all the time!
- Don’t compare your experience to what other people seem to experience, and do what’s right for you. 
  - You may need to spend a little (or a lot) of time on your own each day, or just in a quieter place. 
  - Find a quiet spot somewhere on the property and enjoy your burn.
- Not everyone who goes to DeJā is a party animal – many prefer to sleep in their tent at night and enjoy the daytime activities. 
- Know yourself and your needs, and do what makes YOU happy.
- If you’re feeling particularly overwhelmed, or depressed, come talk to one of the greeters who are more than experienced in offering a friendly ear to those who’re feeling overwhelmed.
- Get plenty of rest, monitor your substance intake and hydrate.
- Don’t be afraid to try new things. If there was ever a space for exploring, this is it! 
- Take responsibility for your own pleasure.

Meeting new people is one of the best parts of DeJā, but some people may find this more challenging than others, especially as several DeJāns know each other from previous years and other burner events. Luckily, there’s plenty of ways to feel more integrated.

- Volunteering is one of the best ways to meet new people. 
  - Working towards a common goal as part of a team lets you meet a great variety of people without having to find ways to break the ice, while giving back to the event. 
  - Build and strike are among the best opportunities to do this. Check out our [Creation page](https://dejā.lv/en/creation/volunteering) for more ideas.
- Workshops are a great way to meet like-minded people especially if you’re walking around on your own.
- Your own camp is a natural place to meet new friends. 
  - <span style ="color:#77011e;">Don’t be</span>  intimidated if people seem to know each other – DeJā is one of the most friendly places you can be, so feel free to join in with groups.
- Icebreaker questions can be a useful thing to have up your sleeve if you’re feeling quite nervous.
