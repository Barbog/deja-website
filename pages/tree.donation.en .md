  Donation Driven, as opposed to Ticket Sales.

  ​

  When DeJā was conceived, we wished to create an event that would serve as a gift from our community of burners to the global community.  We agreed that in the spirit of spreading the culture and eliminating commodification, we would do away with ticket sales, thus making the event accessible to anyone who would be willing to make the trek out here in order to participate. 

  We have been able to follow through on this experiment for 3 years now, as the use of land for the midsummer gathering is a gift from the owner to the community.  In turn, many more now have access to the experience and the magic that occurs at a burn.  Our thinking is that if we remove the price of admission, we would not only be more inclusive, but also be able to create a collaborative gift in which those interested would contribute according to their means.  

  If we can continue to cover our expenses via donations, we can continue to create this event without charging an admission fee.  This is our ultimate goal, to continue co-creating an event which is funded by the participants as well as those who wish to see it grow.  This will allow us continue gifting the event to the community.   If we continue to host this regional gathering, many more will have access to the experience and the magic that occurs when we gather to burn.

  If you wish to attend, you will need to read all the information that is on this website and fill out your visa before the deadline of May 31st, 2017.

  Donations for 2015/Financial Report & Expenses.

  An event such as this does incur expenses.  In 2015, we received 2 generous donations from 2 anonymous benefactors. One donation, was specifically donated, to be used towards sound. The other was used for infrastructure (toilets, transport, effigy, kitchen, hand sanitizer and other random expenses)

  Their total contribution to the event was 1750EUR.  We believe in full transparency, so below we have attached the budget in PDF format showing how we spent the donations last summer. Please take a momentto look it over now.

  In 2016 we received xxxxEUR from xx participants who had been to DeJā before and could not make it as well as from some who were attending for the first time.

  If we were to divide the 1750 EUR amongst the 212 participants, the quotient would come to 8.25EUR in donations per attendee for the 5-day gathering.  Since we do not wish to charge for this event, we are asking you to keep this in mind and to please consider making a donation/gift for our 2016 gathering.
