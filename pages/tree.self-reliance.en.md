We encourage each individual to discover and rely on his or her inner resources – to be self-sufficient and responsible for their own needs: mental, physical, emotional as well as their safety and comfort.

Other participants may share things with you, but this is not something you should rely on or expect.  Be prepared, but do ask for help when needed.
