We encourage each individual to discover and rely on his or her inner resources – to be self-sufficient and responsible for their own needs: mental, physical, emotional; safety and comfort. 

Other participants may share things with you, but this is not something you should rely on or expect.  Be prepared but do ask for help if needed.
