**VOLUNTEERING**

This event is driven by what each of us collectively and individually chose to share – be it time, skills, energy or resources. DeJā happens because of our collective energy.



**PICKING UP AFTER YOURSELF**

It is up to each of us to care for the longevity of our event by remaining aware of ourenvironment, and not leaving any trash anywhere on the property.				



**CONSENT, CONSIDERATION AND BOUNDARIES**

Always ask for consent, always be considerate, and always respect! Communication is the best lubricant – use it!

Although DeJā is an extremely free and open-minded environment, it is important to be respectful of other people’s boundaries! We want to help prevent sexual harassment and assault while ensuring that sex positive free expression thrives. It is imperative to know and express our own sexual boundaries and to respect our partners’ boundaries.

If you feel someone’s behavior is really disrespectful or you feel threatened, ask them to stop. If they continue, report them at the Info Center.



**PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO**

Many opportunities for photography arise at DeJā, but please get the permission for both taking the photo and sharing it online from anyone you might photograph.  Also, no one has a right to photograph or film you if you do not wish to be photographed.
No photos should be taken and published for commercial use!



**HYGIENE**

Please use hand sanitizer: after using toilets, before preparing, cooking or consuming food.



**CONTRIBUTIONS**

These come in the form of time, energy, resources or funds. Everyone involved in the gathering contributes in the best way they can, thus benefiting the entire community. Even though we don’t condone monetary transactions during the event, expenses associated
with producing the event do arise. We ask you to consider contributing in a way in which you feel most comfortable doing so, while keeping in mind that if you decide to contribute financially, you are well within your rights to let us know how you wish for your monetary contribution to be used.
