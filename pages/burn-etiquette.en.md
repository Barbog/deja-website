DeJā is governed by eleven guidelines for how we behave towards each other as participants. These are not rules, they are a source of inspiration from which you to take to heart and interpret for yourself.

**The Code of the Republic**

**Gifting.**

The economy of our community thrives on gifting instead of bartering.  We gift our time, effort and resources because the act of giving feels good. Gifts come from the heart without expectation of anything in return. 

**Fuck Commerce.**

We have removed commercial transactions from our social environments. We choose the joy of participation and sharing over the culture of consumption. DeJā is a place where nothing is sold, traded or bartered. There are no vendors, shops or merchandise. We do not have sponsors; we do not use advertisements or any sort of marketing. By removing commercial transactions we encourage human interaction.

**Co-Creation.**

DeJā comes to life when we cooperate and collaborate. The strength of our community comes from working together. You will be encouraged to share and explore your own creativity and skills. We all are here to share our passions and learn from each other.

**Self-Expression.**

Experience the freedom to be yourself without judgment. Your individuality is one of the many gifts you can share with the community.  DeJā is an opportunity to express yourself freely, while still respecting your fellow participant’s rights and liberties. We respect you and expect the same in return.

**Each One, Teach One.**

In order to maintain the integrity of our culture, those familiar with it are encouraged to help integrate newcomers to the event. We all have skills that we can share with one another. DeJa is an opportunity to learn as well as to teach. This principle allows for the growth of the community, as well as maintaining the integrity of our culture. We are responsible for setting the example to those we invite to our gathering and for guiding any newcomers that we may meet.

**Openness.** 

We welcome everyone and will include them as we wish to be included -- with respect, consideration and tolerance. However, we will exclude anyone who blatantly disregards our code. 

**Be Present.** 

Immediacy - Make now count!  Be present and seize the moment while it lasts! This is all there is, so make the most of it.  In many ways immediate experience is the most important element of our cultural values.

**Self-Reliance.**

You are responsible for you, mentally, physically and emotionally.  We encourage each individual to discover and rely on his or her inner resources – to be self-sufficient and responsible for their own needs, safety and comfort. Other participants may share things with you, but this is not something you should rely on or expect. Be prepared, but do ask for help if needed. 

**Participation.**

No spectators! Get involved.  This is the foundation of our community. DeJā is what we make it. Our contributions are valuable, more so than we may realize. We are a do-ocracy, meaning if you see something that needs to be done, get to it and make it happen!

**Community.**

We are a family of individuals who look after each other.  We are a diverse group of self-reliant individuals, united by tolerance, acceptance, creative pursuits and respect. We believe that an event such as DeJā can bring such like-minded people together in order to affect positive changes, as well as forge lifetime friendships. 

**Environmental Consciousness.**

We are a leave no trace event. Our community fosters a deep responsibility for the environment.  We are committed to leaving no physical trace or damage whenever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and leave only footprints when we leave. As often as possible we leave the places where we gather in a better, more beautiful state than when we found them.

**Consent and Boundaries**

**CONSENT, CONSIDERATION AND BOUNDARIES**

Always ask for consent, 

always be considerate, 

and always respect! 

Communication is the best lubricant – use it!

Although DeJā is an extremely free and open-minded environment, it is important to be respectful of other people’s boundaries! We want to help prevent sexual harassment and assault while ensuring that sex positive free expression thrives. It is imperative to know and express our own sexual boundaries and to respect our partners’ boundaries.

If you feel someone’s behavior is really disrespectful or you feel threatened, ask them to stop. If they continue, report them at the Info Center.

DeJā is a pro-consent event. Although it is an extremely free and open-minded environment, it is important to be respectful of other people’s boundaries! 

 Consent must be clearly granted from an individual who is clearly in control of their faculties enough to grant it.

​	If someone is not in control of their faculties, they cannot grant you consent. 

It is imperative to know and express our own boundaries, sexual or otherwise, and to respect the boundaries of others.

Make sure that all sides are mutually consensual prior to physical encounters (ie hugging, groping, spanking, sexual encounters)

​	For example, while chatting to a nude person you might be fine, but a hug from them might make you feel uncomfortable. 

​		Say so – otherwise they may never guess! 

​	Remember that not everyone might appreciate a bear hug from you either. 

​		Everyone has different boundaries. There’re plenty of people 		 who’d love a hug from you, so don’t force them on people who might not enjoy it – naked or not. There’s no harm in asking.

We want to help prevent sexual harassment and assault while ensuring that sex positive free expression thrives.

If you feel someone’s behavior is really disrespectful or you feel threatened, ask them to stop.  

If someone’s behaviour is really disrespectful or downright dangerous and asking them to stop is not enough, make yourself heard or report them at the Info Center.

**Photo & Video policy**

Many opportunities for photography will arise at DeJā, please ask the individual(s):

​	Permission for taking their photo(s) 

​	If they are ok with you sharing the images online or elsewhere.

​	No one has a right to photograph or film you if you do not wish to be photographed.

<span style="color:red">	**No photos should be taken and published for commercial use!** </span>

​	<span style="color:gold;">SUGGESTION</span>:  You are at DeJā to be at DeJā, not to spend your time on (insert your social media of choice here). Please abstain from posting on social media during the days of the gathering.

**Bring Your Own Cup**

DeJā is a BYOC-event, meaning that you are supposed to bring and take responsibility for your own cup, bowl and cutlery. 

​	There will be participants offering food or drinks and if all of them bring disposable utensils it adds unnecessary strain on both our event and our planet. BYOC solves this problem.

**Leave No Trace**

It is up to each of us to care for the longevity of our event by remaining aware of our environment, and not leaving any trash anywhere on the property.	 Pick up after yourself.

**MOOP** is Matter out of Place. 

​	If it doesn't look like it belongs on the ground, pick it up and put it with your garbage. 

​	Never ever let trash hit the ground.

​	If it is your cigarette butt, beer can or decoration, it goes with you when you leave. No excuses.

​	Please take everything you bring to the event back home with you: pack it in, pack it out – every last tiny scrap.

​	 If you happen to see someone littering, kindly educate them.

​	No trash bins will be provided.
