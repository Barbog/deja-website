<span class="center" style="color:lime;"><u>**Making Your Camp Green**</u></span>

Whether you represent a massive village, a medium-sized theme camp, or stand alone as a camp of one, there are many ways that you can make your camping experience at DeJā more environmenally friendly

Learn and consider the 6 R’s:

- **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Respect.  </span>**
- **<span style="color:lime;">Rethink.</span>**
- **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Reduce.</span>**
- **<span style="color:lime;">Reuse. </span>**
- **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Recycle.</span>**
- **<span style="color:lime;">Restore.</span>**

Keep these in mind from the beginning through to the end of your DeJā experience.


<span style="color:lime;"><u>**Transportation**</u></span>

Coming Alone?
<span style="color:orange;">**Consider**</span> ride sharing to reduce the number of cars going to and from the farm. You can find likely candidates through our car share channel on Slack.

Do you have a lot of stuff to bring for yourself and/or for your camp?  
	Maybe you could band together with other folks near you.

Coming from far away?
<span style="color:orange;">**Consider**</span> inflatable furniture, or a metal-framed futon, which can be disassembled to fit compactly in a car and reused at another event.
