<span class="center" style="color:lime;"><u>**Making Your Camp Green**</u></span>

Whether you represent a massive village, a medium-sized theme camp, or stand alone as a camp of one, there are many ways that you can make your camping experience at DeJā more environmenally friendly

Learn and consider the 6 R’s:

- **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Respect.</span>**
- **<span style="color:lime;">Rethink.</span>**
- **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Reduce.</span>**
- **<span style="color:lime;">Reuse. </span>**
- **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Recycle.</span>**
- **<span style="color:lime;">Restore.</span>**

Keep these in mind from the beginning through to the end of your DeJā experience.


<span style="color:lime;"><u>**Transportation**</u></span>

Coming Alone?
<span style="color:orange;">**Consider**</span> ride sharing to reduce the number of cars going to and from the farm. You can find likely candidates through our car share channel on Slack.

Do you have a lot of stuff to bring for yourself and/or for your camp?  
Maybe you could band together with other folks near you.
Coming from far away?
<span style="color:orange;">**Consider**</span> inflatable furniture, or a metal-framed futon, which can be disassembled to fit compactly in a car and reused at another event.



<span style="color:lime;"><u>**Materials**</u></span>

Think about materials you use to build your camp:
Rather than using materials you might use once and discard,<span style="color:orange;"> **consider** </span>designing camp structures and elements that can be assembled, disassembled and reused year after year.

Rather than buying new construction materials:

- <span style="color:orange;">**Consider**</span> using recycled, repurposed or reclaimed materials.
- **Do** some research and explore the options for obtaining repurposed materials in your area.
- Dumpster dive.
- <span style=color:lime;">**Look**</span> through the classifieds for someone that might have a dome or other infrastructure item they’re hoping to get rid of.

If you must burn elements of your camp,

- <span style="color:tomato;">**do not** </span> paint or treat them with toxic materials that would be released into the atmosphere when burned.
- And, if you must burn, **<span style="color:orange;">consider </span>**purchasing carbon offsets to counter what you’re putting into the atmosphere.

<span style="color:tomato;>"Do not</span> bring anything to the farm without ensuring that you know how it is going to leave.



<span style="color:lime;"><u>**Energy and Lighting**</u></span>

Power and light are an integral part of almost every camp. Many people take it for granted that you may have to run a generator and lights to illuminate your space.
<span style="color:orange;">**Consider**</span> a bio-fuel generator rather than a gas one.

<span style="color:orange;">**Consider Sharing**</span> generator power with your neighbors!

Please don’t use glow sticks!

- These are one-time use.
- They don’t last long.
- They aren’t recyclable.
- They add toxic materials to landfills.

When you need to illuminate yourself, <span style="color:orange;">**consider**</span> a battery or solar-powered LED light string, EL wire, or reflective tape.
