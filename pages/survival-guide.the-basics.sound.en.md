You may want to sleep while others are partying, so we suggest that you bring earplugs, as the sound travels far on the property

There is a “quiet camping” area on the property, so you may consider camping away from the dance areas or sound systems, especially if you are sensitive to noise or have small children.

DeJā provides one sound system for the event, you are encouraged to bring your own or collaborate and create a sound camp of your own with other participants. Be thoughtful of your neighbors.

We have a casual curfew, meaning that between the hours of 6:00 and 9:00 music will be turned down/off to allow people to sleep if they so choose to.
