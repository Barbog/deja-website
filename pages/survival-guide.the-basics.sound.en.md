You may want to sleep while others are partying,

- bring earplugs, as the sound travels far on the property.

There is a “quiet camping” area on the property,

- you may consider camping away from the dance areas or sound systems, especially if you are sensitive to noise or have small children.

DeJā provides one sound system for the event,

- <span style="color:#fdb913;">you are encouraged</span> to bring your own or collaborate and create a sound camp of your own with other participants.
  - if doing so, Be thoughtful of your neighbors.

We have a casual curfew, meaning that between the hours of 6:00am and 9:00am music will be turned down/off to allow people to sleep if they so choose to.
