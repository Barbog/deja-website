**23rd of June** - Jāņi, Līgo

We have chosen the dates of the local midsummer solstice festivities to coincide with our event for several reasons:

- To add the element of a burn to this national holiday and share the burn experience with the local community, as well as those burn curious who have yet to experience our culture.

- To share this magical time and our local traditions with those who travel from outside the Baltic States to celebrate the midsummer with us. 

  ​

On the 23rd we are asking the participants to unplug from the sound systems and tune into the earth and consider playing acoustic sets instead.
