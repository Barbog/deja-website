<span style="color:#77011e;">23rd of June - Jāņi, Līgo</span>

The dates chosen for DeJā coincide with the local midsummer solstice festivities for several reasons:

- To add the element of a burn to this national holiday and share the burn experience with the local community, as well as those burn curious who have yet to experience our culture.

- To share this magical time and the local traditions with those who travel from outside the Baltic States to celebrate the midsummer with us.



On the 23rd the participants are suggested to unplug from the sound systems and tune into the earth.

- Consider playing instruments and acoustic sets instead.
- If you choose to DJ, be mindful of the tunes you choose.
