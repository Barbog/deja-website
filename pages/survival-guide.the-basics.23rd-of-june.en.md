**23rd of June** - Jāņi, Līgo

​We have chosen the dates of the local midsummer solstice festivities to coincide with our event for several reasons:

​To share this magical time and our local traditions with all of those who attend the event from outside the Baltic States.

To add the element of a burn to this national holiday.

To share the burn experience with the local community as well as those burn curious who have yet to experience our culture

To share the local midsummer traditions with those who travel from abroad to celebrate with us.

On the 23rd we are asking the participants to unplug from the sound systems and tune into the earth and consider playing acoustic sets instead.
