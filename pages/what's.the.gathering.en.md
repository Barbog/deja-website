**What is DeJā?**

DeJā - *Degošie Jāņi*- is a Baltic Midsummer solstice celebration.  A  canvas for you to come create and express yourself.  A place where you will meet a diverse borderless community of volunteers, participating to collectively co-create and conjure the magic.  In a surrounding where you will be required to exercise your self-reliance. 

DeJā is guided by the ethos of the [BM](burningman.org) culture An experiment in creativity, expression, participation and cash-free community.  Created, experienced and returned to nothing by you.  

We do not sell tickets to this gathering, No one gets paid to put this together. Nothing is for sale at this event. 

DeJā is a donation-driven gifting society. 

**When is it?**

This summer the dates fall from Wednesday the 21st of June, lasting through the eve of the 25th.

**Where is it?**

The gathering takes place on a private working industrial hemp farm on the southern border of Latvia, meters from the border of Lithuania, located deep in the countryside.  

**Why?**

To gather a collective of individuals and inspire them to create the world they wish to see.
