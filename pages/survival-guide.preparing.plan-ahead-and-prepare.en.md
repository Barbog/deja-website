<span class="center" style="color:dodgerblue;"><u>**Plan Ahead and Prepare**</u></span>

- For each item that you’re bringing to DeJā, think through how you’re going to dispose of it.
- <span style="color:greenyellow green;">**Plan**</span> to send trash off the farm with campmates as they leave the event.

<span style="color:lime;"><u>**Reduce Packaging**</u></span>

Bringing in less means having less to haul out, 

- Leave unnecessary packaging at home.
  - Unpack toys and camping gear you’re bringing with you.
  - Food often comes in layers of plastic and cardboard, toss out the packaging before heading to the farm.
- Choose aluminum cans over bottles, and reusable containers over either of those.


<span style="color:lime;"><u>**Thinking of Pre-cooking?**</u></span>

If you plan on cooking before coming out:

- Prepare food in sensible quantities that your group can finish at a single sitting — leftovers can quickly become a mess.
- Coordinate with your campmates as far as what you’re bringing to minimize waste.
- If you’ve found yourself with a giant pot of food and not enough campmates, invite neighbors over to finish it off.  It beats creating a wet, heavy bag of trash that has to be packed into someone’s trunk.
