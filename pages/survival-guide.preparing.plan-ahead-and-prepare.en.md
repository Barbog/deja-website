**<span class="center" style="color:gold;"><u>Tips and Hints  — During DeJā</u></span>**

**<span style="color:dodgerblue;">Be Aware </span>of Very Small Items**

- No Trace really does mean no trace.
- Be conscious of spare nails or smaller trash particles that may be dismissed as too small for trash including: hair, matches, cigarette butts, feathers, zip ties. 
- After you pick up your trash to carry home, do a last-minute check of your site for cigarette butts, gum wrappers, etc. because many of those will be hidden under tarps, tents and vehicles.
- <span style="color:greenyellow;">**Plan**</span> to send trash off the farm with campmates as they leave the event. 

<span style="color:tomato;">Never</span> let MOOP hit the ground. Clean as you go. MOOP attracts more MOOP. 

- When you see trash on the ground, pick it up and take it with you, including cigarette butts, and then empty your pockets into a trash bag later. 

<span style="color:orange;">Ensure</span>  that the compost pile is treated correctly. Only biodegradable food waste should be put in the compost pile.

- Food waste such as peanut shells, orange peels and eggshells are also trash. Dispose of these in the compost.

  ​

<span style="color:limegreen;">Separate</span>  recycling into glass, plastic, aluminum and cardboard/paper. 

- No trash is to be burned, except for cardboard/paper.




The toilets are compost toilets. If it’s not biodegradable, don’t put it down the toilet. This means no tampons, no cans, no trash, no cigarette butts etc.

- <span style="color:tomato;">Do Not</span> Use the Farm as Your Toilet

  - This is unacceptable, unsanitary, and just plain gross the morning after.

    ​

- Minimize Fire Impacts

  - Keep in mind that most non-natural materials (rugs, polyester, plastic, treated wood) are toxic when burned.

    ​

- Respect Wildlife

  - <span style="color:tomato;">Do not </span> harass wildlife. 
  - If you bring a pet to the DeJā, make certain to remove their waste just as you would your own.
