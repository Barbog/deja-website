A vital aspect of participation is to do our part in keeping trash under control. 

Meaning, if it isn’t part of the natural environment, it needs to be discarded in its' appropriate place – a fire pit if it is burnable, compost if it returns to the environment, recyclable where applicable, and trash if it needs to go out with you. 



Below are some tips as to what you can do to help.

​						<u>**Leave No Trace!**</u>

Practicing a Leave No Trace Ethic is simple:  Leave the place you visit the same or better than how you found it.

- Leave no trace  starts **before** you head out to the farm, it starts when you develop your plan for the burn. 
  - Carefully consider any items you plan on bringing that could become MOOP.

  - Set your end-of-event line sweep plan and schedule.

    ​

- Leave No Trace **continues** when you get to the farm.
  - During your construction process, when you place tarps below  projects to catch stray nails, wood chips, metal shavings and sawdust.

  - Consider bringing a magnet rake as well as other leave no trace supplies.

    ​

- Leave No Trace takes place every moment of the event,
  - <span style="color:red;">**Never**</span>let it hit the ground.
  - MOOP as you go,  pick up other random MOOP.
  - <span style="color:green;">**Carry**</span> a MOOP bag with you, so that you can play your collective part of this community.



It is up to each of us to care for the longevity of our event by remaining aware of our environment and not leaving any trash anywhere on the property.





​						<u>**Tips and Hints**</u>

**Before DeJā**

Preparation is key to leaving a better trace. Please keep the following in mind when packing!

- <span style="color:red;">**Avoid**</span> packing packaging.
- Condense your items and reduce the amount of trash you will need to leave with by, removing the packaging wrappers from anything you will travel with.
- <span style="color:red;">**Avoid**</span> glass – it can shatter.
- <span style="color:red;">**Do not**</span> bring: loose glitter, feather boas. Such items are near impossible to recover.

<span style="color:green;">**Do**</span> bring:

- **Bags** for your garbage.
- **Gloves** – pack work gloves for picking up any sharp bits.
- **Magnet** - to help pick up any metal hardware your project may have left on the ground after being burned.
- **Your own cup, bowl and eating utensils**: disposable cups, plates and cutlery are one of the biggest sources of trash at festivals. Make sure you always have an easy-to-carry cup with you to use anywhere, anytime. Be responsible for your cup.
- **SMOKERS: buy or make a portable ashtray** (a mint tin, for instance) to collect your cigarette butts and ashes.
- **Never, ever drop butts!**
- <span style="color:green;">**Leave space**</span> in your car for taking away your trash.
- If taking the bus or sharing a car, **ensure** you have a way of taking your garbage with you or arrange for its removal.
- <span style="color:orange;">**Tag** </span>all of your belongings (keys, cameras, phones, etc.) you would want returned if misplaced: with your name, phone number and address.

<u>**Plan Ahead and Prepare**</u>

- For each item that you’re bringing to DeJā, think through how you’re going to dispose of it.
- <span style="color:green;">**Plan**</span> to send trash off the farm with campmates as they leave the event.

<u>**Reduce Packaging**</u>

Bringing in less means having less to haul out, 

- Leave unnecessary packaging at home.
  - Unpack toys and camping gear you’re bringing with you.
  - Food often comes in layers of plastic and cardboard, toss out the packaging before heading to the farm.
- Choose aluminum cans over bottles, and reusable containers over either of those.

<u>**Rethink Your Food Portions**</u>

If you plan on pre-cooking before coming out:

- Prepare food in sensible quantities your group can finish at a single sitting — leftovers can quickly become a mess.
- Coordinate with your campmates as far as what you’re bringing to minimize waste.
- If you’ve found yourself with a giant pot of food and not enough campmates, invite neighbors over to finish it off.  It beats creating a wet, heavy bag of trash that has to be packed into someone’s trunk.



**During DeJā**

<span style="color:green;">**Be Aware **</span> of very small items

No Trace really does mean no trace.

- Clean as you go.  MOOP attracts more MOOP.
- When you see trash on the ground, pick it up and take it with you.
- Be conscious of spare nails or smaller trash particles that may be dismissed as too small for trash including: hair, matches, cigarette butts, feathers, zip ties.
- After you pick up your trash to carry home, do a last-minute check of your site for cigarette butts, gum wrappers, etc. 

Ensure that the compost pile is treated correctly.  Only biodegradable food waste should be put in the compost pile.

- Food waste such as peanut shells, orange peels and eggshells are also trash. Dispose of these in the compost.

<span style="color:green;">**Separate**</span> recycling into glass, plastic, aluminum and cardboard/paper.

**No** trash is to be burned, except for cardboard/paper.

The toilets are compost toilets.  If it’s not biodegradable, don’t put it in the hole.  This means no tampons, no trash, no cigarette butts etc.

**Do Not Use the Farm as Your Toilet**  This is unacceptable, unsanitary, and just plain gross the morning after if several hundred people are using the farm in this way.  If you bring a pet with you, make certain to remove their waste just as you would your own.

**Minimize Fire Impacts**  Keep in mind that most non-natural materials (rugs, polyester, plastic, treated wood) are toxic when burned.

**Respect Wildlife**  If you happen to come across any wild life that wanders into camp, please Do not harass it.



<u>**Leaving DeJā**</u>

<span style="color:red;">**Don’t Rush**</span>nor stress to hurry home.

Long-term exposure to the burn may fatigue your body and impair decision-making.

When under pressure, we are all likely to make rushed decisions, miss details and leave things behind.  If you have to catch a plane, make sure to start packing up even earlier than you think you may have to, so you aren’t tempted to leave before fully clearing your site.



<u>**Packing and Departure**</u>

- <span style="color:green;">**Do**</span> a MOOP sweep of your tent area.
- As you’re packing your camp, have campmates walk repeatedly around your site picking up anything and everything that’s not part of the farm.

<span style="color:orange;">**TIP**</span>: Doing this periodically, through the week, will make it easier.

- Do a line sweep of your camp with your campmates, making sure you cover the whole area,  picking up every single piece of MOOP.
- Nothing is too small.  If it wasn’t there before you arrived, it must not be there when you leave.
- If half of your campmates will have left before you, the folks left behind are going to have a lot more work to do.
- <span style="color:orange;">**Remember**</span> to leave enough time to help pack up, clean up and ensure that there is no evidence you were ever there.
- **Sort** your trash and recycling for drop-off at allocated sites on your way home.
- <span style="color:red;">**Do not**</span> dump your trash anywhere in neighboring communities that is not a designated trash or recycling site.
- <span style="color:green;">**Take** your trash with you! And if you have space, please take an orphan bag if you see one at the gate on your way out.
- If you are hauling anything that is not inside your vehicle, stop periodically and check to make sure your vehicle’s load is secured and hasn’t loosened in the wind.





​			<span style="color:green;">**Making Your Camp Green**</span>

Whether you represent a massive village, a medium-sized theme camp, or stand alone as a camp of one, there are many ways that you can make your camping experience at DeJā more environmenally friendly

Learn and consider the 6 R’s

- Respect.
- Rethink.  
- Reduce
- Reuse. 
- Recycle.  
- Restore

Keep these in mind from the beginning through to the end of your DeJā experience.



<u>**Transportation**</u>

Coming Alone?

<span style="color:orange;">**Consider**</span> ride sharing to reduce the number of cars going to and from the farm. You can find likely candidates through our car share channel on Slack.

Do you have a lot of stuff to bring for yourself and/or for your camp?  Maybe you could band together with other folks near you.

Coming from far away?

<span style="color:orange;">**Consider**</span> inflatable furniture, or a metal-framed futon, which can be disassembled to fit compactly in a car and reused at another event.



<u>**Materials**</u>

Think about materials you use to build your camp:

Rather than using materials you might use once and discard,<span style="color:orange;"> **consider** </span>designing camp structures and elements that can be assembled, disassembled and reused year after year.

Rather than buying new construction materials:

- <span style="color:orange;">**Consider**</span> using recycled, repurposed or reclaimed materials.

- **Do** some research and explore the options for obtaining repurposed materials in your area.  Dumpster dive.

- **Look** through the classifieds for someone that might have a dome or other infrastructure item they’re hoping to get rid of.

  ​

If you must burn elements of your camp,

- <span style="color:red;">**do not** </span>paint or treat them with toxic materials that would be released into the atmosphere when burned.
- And, if you must burn, <span style="color:orange;">**consider **</span>purchasing carbon offsets to counter what you’re putting into the atmosphere.

At the very least, don’t bring anything to the farm without ensuring that you know how it is going to leave.



**Energy and Lighting**

Power and light are an integral part of almost every camp. Many people take it for granted that you may have to run a generator and lights to illuminate your space.

<span style="color:orange;">**Consider**</span> a bio-fuel generator rather than a gas one.

<span style="color:orange;">**Consider Sharing**</span> generator power with your neighbors!

Please don’t use glow sticks!

- These are one-time use.
- They don’t last long.
- They aren’t recyclable.
- They add toxic materials to landfills.

When you need to illuminate yourself, <span style="color:orange;">**consider**</span> a battery or solar-powered LED light string, EL wire, or reflective tape.



<span style="color:green;">**Making Your Art Green**</span>

Thank you for contributing art to DeJā.  Art is at the center of our community.  This section can give you some valuable insights and shifts in perspective that will help you make your art more environmentally friendly.

Again, we recommend the 6 R’s:

<span style="color:green;">

- **Respect.  **
- **Rethink.**  
- **Reduce.**
- **Reuse.** 
- **Recycle.** 
- **Restore.**</span>



**Materials**

It is during your planning phase that it is most important to think about the end-game — where will your materials end up?

<span style="color:lavender;">**Think**</span> about your material choices chronologically, and ask yourself:

- Where did they come from?
- How can I use them the most efficiently?
- Where will they end up when I’m done? Landfill?
- Repurposed?
- Burned?
- What’s the most environmentally friendly choice I can make?

Purchase or acquire materials from socially and environmentally conscious sources.

Explore the options for obtaining repurposed materials in your area.

Wherever possible, reuse, repurpose and recycle materials, rather than buying new.

Although it can be more challenging to use repurposed materials, it is more  interesting and compelling to see how you can transmorph the lifecycle of an object.



**To Burn or Not to Burn?**

If you do choose to burn your art, it’s critical you plan to avoid using toxic materials or paint that would be released into the atmosphere.

Paint, very bad to burn.

Plastics, very very bad.



**Lighting and Power**

For your safety and the safety of others,  light your installation at night, even when it’s just a construction site during your setup phase.

In some cases, it is necessary to provide power to your installation. Rather than defaulting to gas-powered generators, look at biodiesel generators, solar, people power or other options.



**Leave No Trace**

Construction materials contribute greatly to MOOP,

Wood chips, splinters, nails, screws and sawdust. Yes, all of those are MOOP.

​Anything not of the farm is considered MOOP, folks.

​Bring a magnet rake with you if you’re doing metal work, including welding, grinding, screws, nails, staples — magnet rakes are a great way to clean up metal quickly and easily.

When you’re building, use tarps or other coverings to catch splinters, metal shavings and sawdust. Yes, it can be a pain to deal with, but it’s certainly better than trying to clean up wood splinters and sawdust from the ground.

Easiest rule of thumb is: **never let it hit the ground**

and (like in any good shop or kitchen) clean as you go.



**Transportation**

If you’re building a particularly large installation, you will find that your transportation costs constitute a very large chunk of your budget — especially if you’re coming from far away. Consider teaming up with other artists or theme camps to share the ride.
