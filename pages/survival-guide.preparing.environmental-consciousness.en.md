A vital aspect of participation is to do our part in keeping trash under control.  Meaning, if it isnâ€™t part of the natural environment, it needs to be discarded in its appropriate place: 

- a fire pit if it is burnable, 
- compost if it returns to the environment, 
- recyclable where applicable, and 
- trash if it needs to go out with you. 



Below are some <span style="color:#fdb913;">tips</span> as to what you can do to help.

<span class="center" style="color:limegreen;"><u>**Leave No Trace!**</u></span>

Practicing a Leave No Trace Ethic is simple: <span style="color:#fdb913;"> Leave the place you visit the same or better than how you found it.</span>

- Leave no trace <span style="color:limegreen;"> starts </span>before you head out to the farm, it starts when you develop your plan for the burn.
  - Carefully consider any items you plan on bringing that could become MOOP.
  - Set your end-of-event line sweep plan and schedule.


- Leave No Trace <span style="color:limegreen;">continues </span> when you get to the farm.
  - During your construction process, when you place tarps below  projects to catch stray nails, wood chips, metal shavings and sawdust.
  - IF your project contains metal hardware, or shavings, 

  <span style="color:#fdb913;"> Consider</span> bringing a magnet rake as well as other leave no trace supplies.


- Leave No Trace takes place <span style="color:limegreen;">every moment of the event.</span>
  - <span style="color:#77011e;">**Never**</span> let it hit the ground.
  - MOOP as you go,  pick up other random MOOP.
  - <span style="color:limegreen;">**Carry**</span> a MOOP bag with you, so that you can play your collective part of this community.



It is up to each of us to care for the longevity of our event by remaining aware of our environment and not leaving any trash anywhere on the property.
