DeJā is a place where nothing is sold, traded or bartered.  There are no vendors, shops or merchandise.  We do not have sponsors; we do not use advertisements or any sort of marketing. 

The gathering is not for profit. 

We choose the joy of participation and sharing over the culture of consumption.  By removing commercial transactions we encourage human interaction.
