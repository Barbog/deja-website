All participants are reminded that despite going to the property to celebrate DeJaÌ„, local and national laws of Latvia still apply.  Please check the local laws before you leave home.

If you are planning on driving while in Latvia, check that your insurance and license are valid in Latvia. You can get advice on this from the Latvian embassy in your country.

During this time of year, there are many checkpoints on the roads.  <span style="color:#77011e;">Please, do not drive while intoxicated!</span>
