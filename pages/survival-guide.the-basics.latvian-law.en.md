All participants are reminded that despite going to the farm to celebrate DeJaÌ„, you are bound by the local and national laws of Latvia. Please check the local laws before you leave home.

If you are planning on driving while in Latvia, you should check that your insurance and license are valid in Latvia. You can get advice on this from the Latvian embassy in your country.

During this time of year, there are many checkpoints on the roads. Please, do not drive while intoxicated!
