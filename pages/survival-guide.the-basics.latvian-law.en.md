All participants are reminded that despite going to the farm to celebrate DeJā, you are bound by the local and national laws of Latvia. Please check the local laws before you leave home.

If you are planning on driving while in Latvia, you should check that your insurance and license are valid in Latvia. You can get advice on this from the Latvian embassy in your country.

During this time of year, there are many checkpoints on the roads. Please, do not drive while intoxicated!

DeJā does not condone illegal drug use and strongly advises against individuals taking risks with their health out in the open country.

Please bear in mind the limited medical support on site before you consider placing yourself at risk.
