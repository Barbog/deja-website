What is DeJā?

* DeJā short for Degošie Jāņi* - a Baltic Midsummer solstice celebration. 
* An autonomous gathering, inspired and guided by the ethos of the [BM](http://burningman.org/) culture.
* A donation-driven, volunteer run event and commercial free zone. No one gets paid to facilitate the event.  Nothing is for sale at this event.  We do not sell tickets to enter this gathering.
* An experiment in creativity, expression, participation and cash-free community.  Created, experienced and returned to nothing by you. 
* A  canvas for you to come create and express yourself.  
* A temporary village where you will meet a diverse, artistic, international collective of individuals, participating to collectively co-create and conjure magic,  in a surrounding where you will be required to exercise your self-reliance.  
* (*Latvian. verb.*)  to dance.  

**When is it?**

DeJā begins Wednesday the 21st of June, and lasts until the eve of the 25th.

**Where is it?**

DeJā takes place on a private, working industrial hemp farm on the southern border of Latvia, meters from the border of Lithuania, located deep in the countryside.  

**Why?**

To gather a collective of individuals and inspire them to create the world they wish to see.
