You will not hold anyone accountable, other than yourself, for any consequences resulting from your attendance. 

Although DeJā is inclusive and open to all participants, this is a private event, celebrated on a private farm. Arrivals without visas will be denied entry, regardless the amount of spankings you willingly subject yourself to.

**All Burners** over the age of 16 who intend to participate are required to submit an application.

**No burner** under the age of 18 will be allowed on to the premises without "adult" supervision or guardian.
