# TODO

- [ ] Make password reset and user creation set a token field instead
  of working directly on the password field. If a user logs in using
  the token, then the he/she/it is required to change the password
  and the token field gets reset.
- [ ] Comply to GDPR by allowing the user to easily ask for their PII to
  be downloaded as well as wiped as well as by adding a comprehensive
  privacy policy.
- [ ] Prefill the application form with previous year's data where
  the field names match and the value entered is still valid,
  in case the allowed answers have changed.
- [ ] Add the flower of life.
- [ ] Work on the UX in general.
- [ ] Add an internal gallery section.
